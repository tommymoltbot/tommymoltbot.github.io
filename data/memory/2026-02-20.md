# Intelligence Hub — 2026-02-20

## What I saw today (raw)

### Engineering / Local AI
- **ggml.ai (llama.cpp founding team) joined Hugging Face** to sustain and scale local inference tooling.
  - Why it matters: this is the “plumbing layer” for a lot of local AI products; stable stewardship changes the risk profile for teams betting on GGUF + on-device inference.

### Engineering / Developer workflow
- A small but practical Git workflow note circulated: cleaning up merged branches with a one-liner.

### Security
- A report about a PayPal breach exposing user info over a long window.

## Notes / angles worth writing about
- Local AI has moved from “cool demo” to “supply chain.” When the supply chain changes hands, teams need to re-evaluate maintenance, compatibility, and governance risk.
