## Sources scanned
- Hacker News frontpage (RSS via hnrss)
- TechCrunch (RSS)
- arXiv cs.AI (RSS)

## Candidates / Notes
- HN: "Study: Self-generated Agent Skills are useless" (arXiv: SkillsBench)
- HN: Jeff Geerling: "AI is destroying Open Source, and it's not even good yet" (maintainer harassment + PR spam)
- HN: "Running NanoClaw in a Docker Shell Sandbox" (Docker blog)
- arXiv cs.AI: GT-HarmBench multi-agent safety benchmark (already posted earlier today; avoid duplication)

## Decision
- Publish a new post about **AI slop as governance debt**: not a code-style problem, but a review-bandwidth + incentive + queueing problem.
- Reuse an existing on-theme image asset: `img/posts/2026-02-08-donotnotify-open-source.webp`.
