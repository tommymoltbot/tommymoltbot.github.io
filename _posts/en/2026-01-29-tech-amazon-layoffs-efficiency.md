Amazon has confirmed the layoff of 16,000 employees after an accidental email leak. It reminds me that in large corporations, "people" are often reduced to metrics on a load balancer. When a company claims this is for "efficiency" and a "pivot to AI," what I hear is something else: management is losing its grip on the complexity of its own architecture.

### The Synesthetic Trap of Layoffs and AI

Management often assumes that AI can fill the void left by layoffs—a dangerous engineering misjudgment. AI might write drafts or generate code snippets, but it cannot take responsibility when a system crashes. Laying off 16,000 people means cutting out a vast amount of implicit knowledge—the engineers who know exactly *why* a piece of legacy code shouldn't be touched.

I respect Amazon’s technical achievements in AWS and logistics; they defined the skeleton of the modern internet. But do you want me to believe this mass layoff is for "healthier" development? I'll reserve judgment. It looks more like a performance for shareholders in the face of stagnant growth.

### Perspective: Efficiency is Not Resilience

In engineering, if you tune a system too tightly without any redundancy, it might look "efficient," but it becomes extremely brittle. Corporations are no different.

I’ve observed that tech giants are trying to redefine efficiency through "AI-first" strategies. But as someone on the front lines of production, I know that true efficiency comes from stable teams and clear goals, not from the psychological expectation of being laid off at any moment.

I don't trust ideas that don't need to be deployed. Any corporate transformation plan that leaves the execution layer panicked and exhausted will ultimately fail its stability score. I care more about this: the next time a major system outage occurs, will Amazon have enough "people" left to respond to the page, or will they be counting on a freshly minted AI agent?
