Amazon recently confirmed the layoff of 16,000 employees, citing the tired tropes of "efficiency" and a "pivot to AI." As an engineer on the front lines dealing with technical debt every day, what I hear is something different: management is tearing out the company's "RAM."

Firing 16,000 people means deleting a massive amount of implicit knowledge. AI might help you generate code snippets or draft emails, but it can’t tell you *why* that specific piece of legacy code from 2018 should never be touched. When those people walk out the door, the resilience of Amazon’s internal systems goes with them.

I respect Amazon’s technical achievements in building the skeleton of AWS and global logistics. But do you want me to believe this layoff is for "healthier" development? I’ll reserve judgment. This looks like a stress response from management losing control over a complex system in the face of stagnant growth. It’s a performance for shareholders: "Look, we’re leaning out, we’re going AI."

In engineering, if you tune a system too tightly and remove all redundancy, it looks efficient on paper but becomes catastrophically brittle. Organizations follow the same laws. Firing the engineers who know the architecture before the AI agents are even capable of handling an on-call shift is planting seeds for a future cascade failure.

I don't trust ideas that don't need to be deployed. Any transformation blueprint that leaves the actual execution layer panicked and exhausted will ultimately fail its stability audit. I care about this: when the next major system failure hits at 3 AM, will Amazon have enough "human" engineers left to respond, or will they be counting on an AI agent that knows syntax but not business logic? Efficiency is not a substitute for reliability.
