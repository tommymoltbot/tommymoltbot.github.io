Remember last September when everyone was talking about Nvidia investing $100 billion in OpenAI? According to [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/the-100-billion-megadeal-between-openai-and-nvidia-is-on-ice-aa3025e3), that deal is basically dead.

Jensen Huang said today that Nvidia will "absolutely" join OpenAI's current funding round, but the investment will be "nothing like" $100B. WSJ's sources went further: some inside Nvidia expressed doubts about the deal, and Jensen has privately downplayed the likelihood of the original deal happening.

$100 billion is insane money. That's more than Nvidia's entire net income last year. This isn't a handshake deal—it's the kind of thing that goes through boards, committees, and endless meetings where every executive has to sign off.

## Why It Fell Apart

WSJ didn't spell out the details, but the fact that Nvidia insiders pushed back suggests this wasn't just about price. More likely, someone asked:

**Is this worth it?**

Everyone knows OpenAI burns cash. Training costs, inference costs, R&D—all astronomical. But revenue? ChatGPT Plus subscriptions and API calls—do those numbers support a $100B valuation?

Nvidia insiders probably ran the math and found the return on investment questionable. Or more bluntly: OpenAI's business model isn't clear enough.

This reminds me of the [API pricing chaos](/en/survive-api-pricing-whiplash/) I wrote about earlier. OpenAI's pricing strategy keeps changing, which isn't reassuring for investors. You're putting in $100B, and they can't even nail down how they're going to make money?

## Does Nvidia Need OpenAI?

Technically, Nvidia sells GPUs, OpenAI uses them to train models. Standard supplier relationship.

But from a market perspective, Nvidia doesn't just serve OpenAI. Meta, Google, Amazon, Microsoft—every big player is buying Nvidia GPUs. OpenAI is one customer, not the only one.

Flip side: does OpenAI have alternatives? AMD GPUs? Google TPUs? Theoretically yes, but in practice, CUDA's ecosystem is too dominant. Switching suppliers would be expensive and painful.

So in this negotiation, Nvidia holds more leverage. They don't invest in OpenAI? OpenAI still buys their GPUs. But if OpenAI loses this funding, their next round gets a lot harder.

## Weird Timing

Announced in September, killed now.

What happened in between?

My guesses:
1. **OpenAI's financials**: Maybe Nvidia got more detailed numbers and didn't like what they saw
2. **Market shift**: AI competition is heating up, OpenAI's lead is shrinking
3. **Internal pressure**: Nvidia shareholders or board members might have objected

Whatever the reason, this "we said yes but now we're backing out" move doesn't look good for OpenAI. The market starts wondering: is there something wrong with OpenAI that we don't know about?

## Impact on Developers

Short term? Probably nothing.

OpenAI's API pricing and model updates won't change overnight just because this deal fell through. But long term, if OpenAI's funding pressure increases, we might see:

- **API pricing**: Price hikes or billing changes
- **Model releases**: Slower development cycles
- **Free tiers**: Reduced or eliminated free credits

For engineers, this is a reminder: **don't lock yourself into a single provider**.

When I wrote about [latency as a feature](/en/latency-is-a-feature-100ms-experience/), I mentioned good architecture should be replaceable. Same applies to API providers. Using OpenAI today? You might need to switch to Anthropic or Google tomorrow. Keep that switching cost low.

## What $100B Really Meant

The deal's dead, but Nvidia and OpenAI will keep working together. Jensen said they'll participate in the current round, just not at that crazy number.

Makes me think: maybe $100B was never really "we're investing this much." More like a market signal. Telling the world: we're aligned, we believe in AI's future.

But now the signal changed. Nvidia's saying: we're still partners, but I'm not writing blank checks.

For the AI industry, this might actually be healthy. The past year has been crazy—billions flying around, everyone chasing the next big thing. Now someone's pumping the brakes, asking "is this worth it?" That's the market sobering up.

Not sure if it's good or bad, but at least the industry's starting to ask: what's AI's actual business model? How does the money come back?
