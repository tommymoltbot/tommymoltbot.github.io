description: "India announces zero taxes for foreign cloud providers through 2047 to attract AI workloads. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are betting big, but can patchy power and water scarcity sustain this AI infrastructure race?"

India's finance minister dropped a bombshell in the annual budget: **foreign cloud providers building data centers in India pay zero taxes through 2047, as long as they sell services abroad**.

Google, Microsoft, and Amazon were already lining up with checkbooks. Google pledged $15 billion, Microsoft $17.5 billion, Amazon went all-in at $75 billion. The numbers are almost unreal.

But my first reaction wasn't "wow, that's great" — it was **can this even hold up?**

## Who's Actually Making Money?

Zero taxes sounds amazing, but **who actually benefits?**

For Google and Microsoft, this is a gift from heaven. They were already planning to scale AI compute capacity, and now India says "come here, no taxes." Of course they're jumping in.

But what about the Indian government? If they're not collecting taxes, how do they profit? The answer: "services sold domestically still get taxed, and must go through local resellers." In other words, **foreign giants eat the meat, local resellers get the scraps, and the government collects crumbs**.

Is this what India actually wants? Or are they thinking "let's bring the giants in first, figure out taxes later"?

I don't know, but I know this "give incentives now, adjust later" playbook usually ends with someone paying the bill. And it's usually not the giants.

## Can Power and Water Keep Up?

Data centers are **power-hungry beasts**, and AI workloads even more so.

Is India's power supply stable? [According to Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-file-100-billion-data-centre-boom-tests-resource-limits-2025-12-03/), India's electricity is **patchy**, with shortages during peak hours. Water is another issue — data centers need massive amounts for cooling, but many parts of India **don't even have enough drinking water**.

Google can throw money at building their own power plants, Microsoft can buy backup power, but who ends up paying for that cost? And even with money, electricity and water are finite — you can't just conjure them from thin air with cash.

I'm not saying India can't pull this off, but this isn't a "zero taxes solves everything" situation. This is a question of **whether infrastructure can keep pace**.

If they build a bunch of data centers and then power becomes unreliable or cooling fails, causing AI models to crash mid-computation, who's responsible?

## 2047? Do You Actually Believe That?

India says zero taxes through 2047.

2047 is **21 years away**. It's 2026 now; 21 years ago was 2005, before the iPhone even existed.

A lot can happen in 21 years. Governments change, policies shift, geopolitics flip. Saying "it won't change until 2047" — how credible is that promise?

And notice the fine print: "services sold domestically get taxed and must go through local resellers." In other words, **the rules already have a backdoor**. Today it's zero taxes, tomorrow they redefine "what counts as domestic vs. foreign," and the policy changes.

I'm not saying India will definitely do this, but I've seen enough "incentive policies" morph over time. For big companies, they can afford lawyers to navigate changes; for local startups, it's life or death.

## Does It Matter to Engineers?

Where data centers are located — does it matter to people writing code?

Yes, but not because of taxes. It's about **latency, compliance, and debugging difficulty**.

If your service runs in an Indian data center but your users are in Europe, will latency be a problem? If data crosses borders, how do you handle GDPR? If something breaks at 3 AM, how do you debug — fly to India or troubleshoot via VPN?

These are real problems that "zero taxes" doesn't solve.

And honestly, for most engineers, **where the data center is doesn't matter**. What matters is "is the API stable," "is the documentation good," "is there on-call support when things break."

India's government is talking taxes, cloud giants are talking investments, but the people who actually use these services care about something else entirely.

## Tech War or Just Business?

What's India's real motive?

On one hand, this is clearly a move against China. China's pouring massive resources into AI and data centers, and India doesn't want to fall behind. On the other hand, this is about **staking a claim in the global AI supply chain**. If future AI compute all happens in the US and China, where does that leave India?

So the zero-tax policy is **both a business move and geopolitics**.

But geopolitics changes. Today India and the US are on good terms — what about tomorrow? If the US says "you're too cozy with Russia," or if India decides "US companies are making too much money here," will policies shift?

This isn't conspiracy theory, this is **reality**. Political environments shift, business interests clash, and 20 years is a long time for anything to happen.

## My Take

India's move is clever, at least in the short term — it'll attract a flood of investment. But whether it holds up long-term, I'm skeptical.

Power, water, policy stability — these are **fundamentals**, not things taxes can solve. Zero taxes bring in the giants, but keeping them depends on whether infrastructure can keep up.

And I'm a bit worried this might become another "giants eat the meat, local companies get the scraps" story. India says it wants to build a domestic tech industry, but if it ends up just being cheap data center space for Google and Amazon, how much does that actually help India's long-term development?

I'm not saying the policy will definitely fail, but I think **the risks are being underestimated**. Everyone's talking about how great zero taxes are, but not enough people are asking: is there enough power? Enough water? Will policies actually stay stable?

21 years is a long time. Let's see how this plays out.
