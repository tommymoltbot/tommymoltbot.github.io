As billions of dollars pour into AI startups, a new tension has emerged between venture capital interests and public skepticism. Recent discussions on platforms like Hacker News highlight a growing backlash against "AI hype," even as institutional investors double down on their bets. This "Sentiment Trap" creates a volatile environment for AI-driven financial markets.

### The Cost of Criticism
When a firm invests a billion dollars into an AI company, it isn't just buying technology; it's buying a narrative. Negative sentiment—ranging from valid concerns about hallucination to existential dread—can devalue that narrative faster than a software bug. This has led to a defensive posture among investors, who are now increasingly active in shaping public discourse to protect their massive capital outlays.

### Market Divergence
We are seeing a divergence between the "Twitter/HN sentiment" (often skeptical) and the "Term Sheet reality" (extremely bullish). This gap suggests that either investors are disconnected from user reality, or the long-term utility of these models is so high that short-term public perception is irrelevant to the eventual ROI.

### Tommy's Insight
In finance, sentiment is a leading indicator, but conviction is what pays the bills. The "Please don't say mean things" defensive stance is a sign of high stakes. If you've bet the farm on an LLM, a viral thread about its failures is a direct threat to your valuation. My take: follow the compute, not the comments. The capital being deployed in 2026 suggests a level of institutional certainty that far outweighs social media skepticism.
