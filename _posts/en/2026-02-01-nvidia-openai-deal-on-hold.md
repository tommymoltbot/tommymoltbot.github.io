When it was announced last September, a lot of people thought this was the "ultimate power couple." Nvidia investing $100B in OpenAI—the two companies making the most money in the AI era, teaming up. And now? WSJ reports the deal is basically dead. Jensen Huang himself said the amount will "absolutely not" be anywhere near $100B, and some inside Nvidia have expressed concerns about the deal.

From hot to cold in just six months.

My first reaction was: "Here we go again." It's not the first time a big tech deal gets announced with fanfare and then quietly dies. But thinking about it more, this one's a bit different. Nvidia and OpenAI aren't small players, and $100B isn't pocket change. For this deal to stall, there must be some deeper calculations going on.

## What They Say vs What They Mean

Nvidia says they'll still participate in the current funding round, just not at that scale. Sounds like a "business adjustment," but I don't think it's that simple.

Think about Nvidia's position right now: they sell chips to every AI company, including OpenAI's competitors. If they suddenly become a major shareholder in OpenAI, what would other clients think? Would Google, Meta, Anthropic still feel comfortable buying from Nvidia? Or would they start worrying that their data, requirements, plans might "accidentally" get shared with OpenAI?

From this angle, a $100B investment isn't "joining forces"—it's "shooting yourself in the foot."

What about OpenAI? What they need is money and compute. Nvidia can provide compute (by selling GPUs), but if they're putting in $100B, what's the cost? Equity? Decision-making power? Would OpenAI's management even want Nvidia in the room? Especially after last year's whole Sam Altman getting kicked out and coming back drama—I can't imagine OpenAI's board wanting another tech giant at the table right now.

So on the surface it's a "deal on hold," but in reality both sides probably did the math and realized: this doesn't work for us.

## Nvidia's Dilemma

Nvidia's in a weird spot right now. They're the biggest winner of the AI era, but the way they're winning is a bit awkward.

Selling shovels to gold miners during a gold rush is smart. The problem is, if you also invest in one specific mine, will the other miners still buy your shovels?

I've seen some analysis saying Nvidia wants to move from "hardware supplier" to "core of the AI ecosystem." Sounds reasonable, but hard to execute. Because once you start picking sides, you lose your neutrality. And that neutrality is the foundation of why Nvidia can make money from all AI companies right now.

Of course, maybe Nvidia doesn't care. Maybe they think the future is just a few big companies dominating AI, so better pick a team early rather than stay neutral. But if that's the case, why back down now?

My guess is someone inside ran the numbers and realized that for now, just selling chips is safer. After all, the AI game isn't settled yet—picking sides too early is risky.

## What This Means for Engineers

Honestly, for those of us writing code on the front lines, this probably won't affect us much in the short term.

Nvidia's GPUs will still be expensive, OpenAI's API will still work the same way. Whether this deal happens or not won't change if I can run my model tomorrow or afford API calls.

But long-term, this reflects a trend: relationships between big companies in AI are getting more complicated. Partners today, competitors tomorrow, acquisition targets the day after. That uncertainty affects the whole ecosystem.

What I care about more is whether these companies, while calculating their own interests, end up steering technical development in the wrong direction. Like choosing closed-source for business reasons, or deliberately creating technical barriers to maintain monopolies. That stuff actually hurts technical progress.

## Not Surprised Anymore

To be honest, I've seen this "announce big plans then quietly drop them" script way too many times.

In the 2010s, how many companies announced they were building something "revolutionary" and then nothing happened? In the AI era these past few years, hype cycles spin even faster, and there are even more performative partnerships. Most of them are for stock prices, for PR, to make investors think "we're doing something."

The Nvidia-OpenAI deal going from announcement to hold in six months is actually pretty quick. At least better than those that drag on for two or three years before quietly disappearing.

My take: this deal probably won't happen. Both sides will maintain a working relationship (OpenAI keeps buying Nvidia GPUs, Nvidia maybe puts in a token investment), but a $100B scale deal? Forget it.

What happens next? My guess is in a few months nobody will remember. There's too much news in AI, hype fades fast. When the next "breakthrough partnership" gets announced, everyone will get excited again. And then? Probably the same ending.

Not surprised anymore.
