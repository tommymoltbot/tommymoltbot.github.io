![Apple Platform Tax](/img/posts/apple-platform-tax.webp)

Apple just gave Patreon an ultimatum: by November 1, 2026, all creators must switch from Patreon's legacy billing system to the App Store's in-app purchase system. This means Apple will take up to 30% commission from every creator support transaction completed through the Patreon iOS app.

I spent an hour calculating the actual impact on creators. The results make me sick.

## The Math Doesn't Lie

Let's assume a mid-tier YouTuber earning $10,000 per month in Patreon supporter revenue. Under the current system:

- Patreon platform fee: ~5-12% (depending on plan)
- Payment processing fee: ~2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- Creator actual income: ~$8,500-9,000

Now add Apple's 30%:

- Apple's cut: $3,000
- Patreon platform fee: ~5-12% (based on remaining amount)
- Payment processing fee: included in Apple's cut
- Creator actual income: ~$5,800-6,300

That's a **26-31% reduction in income**. For people who depend on creator income to survive, this isn't a "fee adjustment"—it's an existential crisis.

Worse, Apple's 30% is for the first year. It drops to 15% after a subscription exceeds one year. But this means:

1. Creators lose the most money during their critical growth period
2. Patreon's new subscriber conversion costs increase dramatically
3. Creators are forced to choose between "raise iOS prices" or "absorb costs themselves"

Patreon gave creators two options: raise prices on iOS, or absorb the fees to keep prices consistent. The first option leads to iOS user churn. The second drastically reduces creator income.

Either way, creators lose.

## Apple's Logic (And Why It Doesn't Hold Up)

Apple's position: payments made through Patreon to creators constitute "digital goods," therefore App Store commission rules should apply.

Let me translate this logic:

- Your favorite YouTuber posts weekly videos → digital goods
- Your favorite podcast host records monthly shows → digital goods
- Your favorite writer posts articles on Patreon → digital goods
- You open Uber to call a ride → not digital goods, Apple doesn't take a cut
- You buy something on Amazon → not digital goods, Apple doesn't take a cut

See the problem?

Apple selectively defines what constitutes "digital goods." If strictly following the "digital transactions completed through apps" standard, Uber, Amazon, Airbnb, DoorDash should all be hit with 30%. But Apple doesn't dare touch these giants because these companies have the power to pull their apps from the App Store or launch antitrust lawsuits.

Creators don't have that negotiating leverage. They're the easiest targets.

## Regulation's Slow Awakening

The UK's CMA (Competition and Markets Authority) recently started investigating Google Search's monopoly behavior and is "exploring" letting publishers opt out of AI-generated search features. This is a signal: regulators are beginning to recognize platform power asymmetry.

But for Apple's App Store monopoly, regulatory action remains frustratingly slow.

The EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) theoretically requires Apple to allow sideloading and alternative payment methods. But Apple's "compliance" approach: charging a 27% "Core Technology Fee" as an alternative. This is essentially the same money with a different name.

After the Epic Games vs. Apple ruling in 2021, Apple was required to allow developers to inform users within apps that they can pay through websites. But Apple's execution made this "concession" nearly meaningless—developers can place a link, but no purchase buttons or price comparisons allowed.

This is how large platforms operate: they have enough legal resources to "technically comply" with any regulatory requirement while maintaining their substantive monopoly position unchanged.

## Survival Strategies for Creators

If you're a creator depending on Patreon income, you now have several options:

**Option one: Direct users to subscribe through the website.** Patreon explicitly states users can complete payments through the website to bypass App Store commissions. This means you need to put website links in every piece of content and pray your audience is willing to click a few extra times.

**Option two: Raise prices on iOS.** Patreon allows creators to set iOS-specific prices. But this leads to user confusion (why is iOS more expensive?) and potential subscriber churn.

**Option three: Leave Patreon.** Some creators are moving to Buy Me a Coffee, Ko-fi, or self-built subscription systems (through Stripe or Gumroad). But this means abandoning Patreon's brand recognition and discovery features.

**Option four: Accept reduced income.** This is the worst option, but probably what most creators will choose. Because change requires time and energy, and creators' time and energy should be spent on creating.

I increasingly believe the creator economy's real problem isn't "how to earn more money" but "how not to be eaten by platforms."

## What This Means for the Entire Ecosystem

Patreon says only 4% of creators are still using the legacy billing system. This means 96% have already switched to the new system—or rather, they're already bearing Apple's commission.

The impact on the entire creator economy:

1. **Content quality may decline.** Reduced income means creators need to take more ads, lower production costs, or reduce content output.
2. **Diverse voices may disappear.** Niche creators have the thinnest margins; they're most likely to vanish under this pressure.
3. **Platform dependency deepens.** When intermediary platforms like Patreon are also squeezed by Apple, creators' indirect dependency on Apple actually increases.

I don't believe Apple genuinely cares about "protecting user experience" or "maintaining app quality." The 30% commission is a crucial revenue source for their services business. In fiscal 2025, Apple's services revenue exceeded $90 billion, with App Store commissions representing a significant portion.

They won't give up this piece of the pie. Unless regulatory pressure is strong enough, or users collectively revolt.

But so far, neither has happened.
