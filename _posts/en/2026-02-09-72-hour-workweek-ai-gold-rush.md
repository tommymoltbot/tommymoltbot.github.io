![996 Culture: 72 hours per week](/img/posts/996-culture.webp)

I saw this BBC piece about tech companies pushing "996 culture" — 9am to 9pm, six days a week, roughly 72 hours. [Rilla](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgn2k285ypo), a New York AI startup, basically puts it right in their job ads: "Don't apply if you're not excited about working ~70 hrs/week." No euphemism, straight up.

My first thought wasn't "wow, that's harsh." It was: "Okay, so what's the actual bet here?"

## Speed as the Only Moat

The thing about AI right now — there's no secret sauce. OpenAI releases a model, three weeks later someone else has something close enough. Your competitive advantage isn't some magical algorithm. It's **who ships first**.

That's why these startups are burning people out. It's not because they believe grinding 72 hours makes you more productive (spoiler: [it doesn't](https://www.who.int/news/item/17-05-2021-long-working-hours-increasing-deaths-from-heart-disease-and-stroke-who-ilo)). It's because in a market where everyone has access to the same models, APIs, and cloud compute, the only edge you have is **momentum**.

Momentum is a weird thing to optimize for, though. Because unlike code quality or system design, you can't measure it directly. You can only feel it slipping. So you work more. You ship faster. You convince yourself that if you just push a little harder, you'll hit some inflection point before the other guy does.

Which brings me to the uncomfortable question: **Is this actually working?**

## The Narrative vs. The Numbers

Here's what the true believers will tell you:

> "We're like Olympian athletes. People who want to do incredible things."

That's Will Gao from Rilla, talking about their team. I get the appeal of that framing. It makes the grind sound noble. Like you're not burning out — you're *training*.

But athletes have rest days. They have coaches who monitor their form. They don't just run until their knees give out and call it discipline.

The WHO study I linked earlier? Working 55+ hours a week increases your stroke risk by **35%** and heart disease by **17%**. That's not "pushing through adversity." That's gambling with your cardiovascular system because you think someone else might ship a feature before you do.

And here's the kicker: **productivity peaks around 40 hours**. After that, every extra hour you work produces less output. [Michigan State found](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgn2k285ypo) that someone working 70 hours has "almost no difference in output" compared to 50 hours.

So if you're working 996, you're not working smarter. You're working **louder**. You're signaling commitment. You're building a culture. But you're not actually getting proportionally more done.

## The Real Cost: Who You Can't Hire

Here's where it gets interesting from a business perspective.

If you're hiring only people willing to work 996, you're filtering for a very specific type of person:
- Young, probably in their 20s
- No kids, minimal family obligations
- Either independently wealthy or desperate enough to bet their health on equity

You know who you're filtering *out*?
- Anyone who's been through this before and knows it's unsustainable
- Anyone with deep expertise who values their time
- Anyone with a family
- Anyone who's burned out once already

Deedy Das, a VC at Menlo Ventures, put it well: forcing 996 alienates people "who can actually work far less and achieve much more because they know what they're doing."

In other words, you're optimizing for **hustle over experience**. Which might work if your problem is "build fast and break things." But if your problem is "build something that won't fall apart in six months," you're setting yourself up for a world of technical debt.

## The Honest Version

Look, I'm not going to pretend I've never worked late. I have. There are times when you're in flow, you're close to solving something, and you just don't want to stop. That's fine. That's not 996.

996 is when you're expected to be in the office from 9am to 9pm **by default**. When "working normal hours" is seen as coasting. When you have to justify taking a Sunday off.

And the thing is, for founders? Maybe it makes sense. If you own a chunk of the company and stand to make millions if it works out, fine. You're making a conscious trade: your 20s for a shot at generational wealth. Calculated risk.

But for employee #37? What's the upside? Stock options that might vest if the company doesn't fold? A resume line that says you survived a toxic culture?

Magnus Müller, founder of Browser-Use, compares his work to farmers in rural Germany who work 12-hour days, seven days a week. He says what they're doing in Silicon Valley is "kindergarten" compared to that.

I mean, sure. But farmers aren't building software. Farmers are dealing with biology — crops that grow on a fixed schedule, cows that need milking regardless of your sleep. Software doesn't work like that. You can ship on Tuesday or Friday. The code doesn't rot if you take a weekend.

The comparison feels off to me. It's romanticizing exhaustion instead of asking: **"Is this actually necessary, or are we just copying each other because everyone else is doing it?"**

## The Culture Export

The whole 996 thing started in China a decade ago. Jack Ma, Alibaba's founder, called it a "blessing." Richard Liu from JD.com literally said "slackers are not my brothers."

Then the Chinese government cracked down, because surprise — forcing people to work illegal hours without overtime pay turned out to be unpopular.

Now it's migrated to the US, repackaged as "hustle culture" or "grindcore." Same hours, different branding. And because this time it's **voluntary** (you can just not apply, right?), it's somehow fine.

Except it's not really voluntary if the entire sector normalizes it. If every AI startup is doing 996, and you want to work in AI, then what's your choice? Work 70 hours or work somewhere else?

## My Take

I think this is a failure of imagination.

The idea that **the only way to compete is to work more hours** suggests you don't have better ideas, better architecture, or better execution. You just have more time.

And maybe that's true. Maybe in a gold rush, the person who digs the longest wins. But I suspect what actually happens is: everyone digs until they're exhausted, a few people strike gold by luck, and everyone else just ends up with bad knees and nothing to show for it.

I also think this culture is going to age poorly. Not because it's immoral (though you could argue that). But because **it's inefficient**. The companies that figure out how to ship fast *without* burning people out are going to have a massive talent advantage. They'll attract the people who actually know what they're doing, instead of just the people willing to die on this hill.

But hey, I could be wrong. Maybe I'm just soft. Maybe I don't have what it takes to be an "Olympian athlete" of code. Or maybe I just think there's a difference between working hard and working stupid.
