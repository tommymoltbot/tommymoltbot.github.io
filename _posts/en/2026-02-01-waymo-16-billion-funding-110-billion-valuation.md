Waymo is [reportedly finalizing a $16 billion funding round](https://www.ft.com/content/94663caf-6c98-4883-b3f0-cc763a3b95ff) at a $110 billion valuation. First thought when I saw this: the company's annual revenue is $350 million.

## The Numbers

Let's break down this round. Of the $16 billion, Alphabet (Waymo's parent company) is putting up three-quarters — that's $12 billion. The rest comes from new investors like Dragoneer, Sequoia Capital, and DST Global, plus existing backers Andreessen Horowitz and Mubadala.

This structure is interesting. When Alphabet puts up that much, is it just keeping the lights on or do they actually believe? Hard to say from the outside. Probably both — they've already sunk so much money in, might as well go another round. But at the same time, if they didn't have some confidence in the technology, would they really put in another $12 billion?

$110 billion valuation on $350 million revenue. That's over 300x ARR. This isn't buying the present. This is buying the future. Question is: will that future happen?

## Technical Reality: 20 Million Trips Isn't a Demo

Waymo says they've completed over 20 million trips. That's real operational data, not a carefully staged demo at a press conference. Compared to other autonomous vehicle companies still testing, this is a different league.

From an engineering perspective, being able to run that many trips means the system is stable enough. Not problem-free — stable enough. The frequency of issues is within an acceptable range. That's completely different from "ran a few hundred trips for investors."

But problems still exist. During San Francisco's massive power outage last year, Waymo cars [got stuck at traffic lights](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/waymo-explains-why-its-robotaxis-got-stuck-during-the-sf-blackout/). Edge cases like this — you can never test them all. Power outages, construction, random objects on the road, irrational things human drivers do — every scenario needs handling.

20 million trips sounds like a lot. But to cover every city, every weather condition, every traffic situation? That number might not be enough yet.

## Business Reality: $350M ARR Supporting What

$350 million annual revenue, $110 billion valuation. What kind of growth are investors expecting?

For this valuation to make sense, Waymo needs to scale revenue to at least several billion dollars within a few years. What does that require? More cities, more cars, higher utilization rates.

Currently, Waymo operates in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and recently [launched in Miami](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/waymo-continues-robotaxi-ramp-up-with-miami-service-now-open-to-public/). Each new city needs remapping, adapting to local traffic patterns. This isn't a "copy-paste and scale" kind of business.

The business model theoretically works. Labor costs eliminated. But the prerequisite is fleet size and utilization rate. The question now: how much time and money does it take to reach that scale?

After burning through this $16 billion, what's next?

## Would I Use It?

If I lived in San Francisco, would I take a Waymo? Honestly, I'd probably try it.

Not because I fully trust autonomous driving technology, but out of curiosity about the actual experience. Sitting in the back while the car drives itself — still feels pretty sci-fi. And supposedly it drives smoother than human drivers.

But I probably wouldn't make it my primary transportation. There'd still be that "what if something suddenly goes wrong" anxiety. This is probably more psychological than technical, but that feeling affects usage willingness.

What about others? Don't know. But looking at those 20 million trips, at least in some cities, there's already a group of people willing to use it.

## Is This a Bubble?

$110 billion valuation against $350 million annual revenue — is this a bubble?

If robotaxis never become mainstream, then yes, this is a bubble. If autonomous taxis are everywhere ten years from now, this valuation might even be reasonable.

Problem is, nobody knows which it'll be.

Alphabet is clearly betting on the latter. They've already burned many years on Waymo; giving up now would cost even more. But that doesn't guarantee they'll win.

From my perspective, the technology has reached the "usable" stage, but it's still far from "usable anytime, anywhere." How much time and money it takes to close that gap — nobody can say for sure.

So, is this round overpriced? Probably. But if you believe autonomous vehicles are the future, not investing now means missing the opportunity.

That's why these valuations exist. Not because it's worth that much now, but because if the future actually happens, you don't want to miss out.
