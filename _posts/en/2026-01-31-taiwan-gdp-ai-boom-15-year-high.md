Taiwan's GDP grew 8.63% in 2025, the highest in 15 years. Q4 jumped to 12.68%, far exceeding the initial forecast of 7.91%. [According to Taiwan's DGBAS](https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202601300021), this growth was primarily driven by AI-related exports — chips, servers, and components flying off the shelves.

Per capita GDP reached $39,477, surpassing Japan ($34,713) and South Korea ($35,962). Sounds impressive, but let's cool down — part of this number came from currency appreciation, as the Taiwan dollar strengthened.

## How Did This Growth Happen?

Simple: the world is going crazy for AI, and AI needs chips. TSMC, MediaTek, and other semiconductor companies are flooded with orders, pulling the entire supply chain along. Not just exports — domestic consumption also picked up with a recovering car market, government cash handouts, and active stock trading.

DGBAS said they initially expected US tariffs on semiconductor products, which led to conservative forecasts. Those tariffs never materialized, and AI demand exceeded expectations, sending Q4 soaring.

Taiwan outperformed China (5%), Singapore (4.8%), and South Korea (1%) — the best performance in East Asia.

## But I Have Some Questions

### 1. Is This Real Demand or a Short-Term Bubble?

How long can the AI boom last? Everyone's scrambling to buy GPUs and build data centers, but will all of this generate corresponding business value? Or is it just "everyone else is buying, so I should too"?

If AI investment cools down, will Taiwan's orders shrink accordingly? This growth model, heavily reliant on a single trend, feels like betting that "AI will stay hot forever."

### 2. Taiwan's Strength Is Manufacturing, Not AI Itself

Taiwan excels at semiconductor manufacturing, not developing AI models or applications. We're selling "shovels" (chips), not "gold mines" (AI services).

There's a risk here: if the US or China starts making their own chips (though they can't match TSMC's standards yet), or if geopolitical shifts reorganize supply chains, could Taiwan's advantage be eroded?

### 3. Have Engineers' Salaries Kept Up?

Companies are making bank, GDP looks great, but is the money flowing to the workers? Salaries in Taiwan's semiconductor industry are rising, but there's still a gap compared to the US. And not everyone works at TSMC — have employees in traditional industries and SMEs benefited from this wave?

Per capita GDP is an average, and averages can be misleading. The wealthy make more, pulling up the average, but most people might not feel the difference.

### 4. Is This Growth Model Sustainable?

Taiwan also had high growth 15 years ago during the global tech boom, but what happened after? Growth slowed, and the economic structure didn't fundamentally change.

Will this AI-driven growth follow a similar pattern? A short-term burst without building long-term competitiveness?

## Uncertain, But Not All Bad

Honestly, I'm skeptical about growth models that rely on a single industry windfall. But I can't completely dismiss it either — Taiwan is genuinely strong in semiconductors, and no competitor can replace it in the short term.

I just wonder: if the AI boom fades, what's Taiwan's Plan B? Is the money earned now being invested in the next decade's competitiveness?

Or are we just riding this wave and waiting for the next tech surge? That's fine too, but the risk is that if we bet wrong or the next wave takes too long, there'll be a vacuum period in between.

## Impact of the Taiwan-US Trade Agreement

The recent Taiwan-US trade agreement lowered tariffs to 15% without stacking with other duties. This benefits traditional industries (machine tools, bicycles, hardware) and could boost export competitiveness.

But it also means Taiwan is more dependent on the US market. If US policy changes or Sino-US relations shift again, will Taiwan's exports be affected?

## My Take

This growth is impressive, but I'm not getting too excited. It's mainly driven by external demand (the AI boom), not new demand or industries created by Taiwan itself.

Taiwan's strength lies in execution and manufacturing capability, but innovation and business model development remain weak spots. If the money earned now is invested in talent cultivation, R&D, and industrial diversification, this growth could have long-term significance.

Otherwise, it's just riding one wave and waiting for the next. That works too, but I think it's a bit of a missed opportunity.
