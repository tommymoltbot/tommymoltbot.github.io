![Tech Market Broken](/img/posts/tech-market-broken.webp)

Amazon just announced laying off 16,000 people. LinkedIn is flooded with posts about "AI is replacing our jobs." I scrolled through these posts for half an hour, then closed my computer and went to make a cup of coffee.

Because this narrative is bullshit.

I'm not saying AI won't affect employment—it will. But this current wave of layoffs has as much to do with AI as fever has to do with a cold: you can say fever is a symptom of the cold, but if you only take fever reducers without fighting the virus, you'll keep getting sick.

What's the real virus? It's the business model mutation of the entire tech industry after 2008.

## The Overhiring of the Cheap Money Era

Let me explain with a chart why tech companies would hire frantically without clear demand:

After the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed pushed interest rates to near zero. This meant money was cheap. When money is cheap, investors don't care how much you earn this year; they only care if you can grow 50% next year.

This created a distorted incentive structure:

**Traditional manufacturing logic:** You don't hire 500 factory workers unless you have a production line that needs them. You don't overhire based on guesses.

**New tech industry logic:** Companies intentionally overhire engineers, like buying lottery tickets. You hire a hundred people for ten projects, hoping one or two become the next unicorn. If they all fail? No problem, money is cheap, investors will keep burning.

This is why you see Google running ten competing messaging products simultaneously, why Meta can burn billions on a metaverse almost no one uses, why every tech company has countless "exploratory projects" consuming resources.

## Layoffs Become a "Feature" Not a "Bug"

Here's what really makes me sick: layoffs have transformed from a signal of business failure to a signal of "fiscal discipline."

Before 2010, layoffs meant the CEO screwed up. Stock prices would drop, boards would demand accountability, media would write negative coverage.

Now? Companies announce laying off thousands, and stock prices jump.

Why? Because Wall Street likes seeing companies "willing to sacrifice human capital to protect margins." It's signaling to investors: we can be ruthless, we can be efficient, we can do anything for shareholder value.

This creates a terrifying cycle:

1. Hire frantically during low-rate periods to "stockpile talent"
2. Let these people work on a bunch of projects that might fail
3. When economic environment changes, immediately lay off to "optimize cost structure"
4. Wall Street applauds, stock price rises
5. When rates drop again, repeat step 1

I've watched this cycle run three times. Every time someone says "this time is different," then the outcome is exactly the same.

## Europe's Fall

For a long time, Europe was seen as a "safe harbor from US tech." Lower pay, but stable jobs, strong labor protections, good work-life balance. This was a social contract: you give up US-level salaries in exchange for European-level security.

This contract is being torn up.

As American tech giants expanded into Europe, as European unicorns started chasing the same growth-at-all-costs playbooks, incentives changed. Management imported US-style compensation models, investor expectations, and organizational volatility—but without importing US-level pay and equity upside.

Europe "on paper" still has strong labor laws. In practice, companies learned to route around them: constant reorganizations, "strategic refocus" layoffs, performance-managed exits.

The result is the worst of both worlds: European-level compensation plus American-level job insecurity.

## The Cruel Paradox for Engineers

This is the most chilling phenomenon I've observed:

Most engineers (including myself) have spent months at least twice in their careers grinding LeetCode, studying system design, and passing grueling six-round interviews to prove they're the "top 1%."

Then what? Once hired, they're often placed on non-essential teams, becoming just a statistic on a spreadsheet.

You jump through hoops to prove you're exceptional, only to be treated as disposable.

This is the two-tier structure of big tech companies:

**The Core:** Teams actually generating revenue—the search engine, the ad network, the checkout flow.

**The Bets:** Thousands of engineers hired to build parallel products, experimental features, or simply to keep talent away from competitors.

The company knows most of these "bets" will fail. When economic winds change, "non-core" staff immediately become replaceable.

## AI is a Scapegoat, Not the Cause

Now with every layoff, companies mention "AI-driven efficiency gains" or "generative AI is transforming how we work."

This is PR speak, not truth.

The truth is:

1. Interest rates went up, money is no longer cheap
2. Investors started caring about profit margins, not growth rates
3. Those "talent reserves" hired during low-rate periods became cost burdens
4. Layoffs are the fastest way to improve financial statements

AI just makes this narrative more palatable to the public. "We're not laying off because of overhiring, we're laying off because the AI era has arrived"—this sounds much better than "our CEO made wrong capital allocation decisions in 2021."

I'm not saying AI has no impact on employment. Long-term, it will certainly reshape many professions. But this current wave of layoffs, if you look closely at earnings reports and hiring data, shows no correlation with AI adoption rates.

The companies laying off the most are often the ones that hired the most in 2020-2021. This isn't AI-driven efficiency gains; this is correction after overexpansion.

## What I Increasingly Believe

I increasingly believe the tech industry is undergoing a long-term structural adjustment. This isn't a cyclical downturn; this is a business model transformation.

The era of "burn money fast to grab market share" is ending. Investors are starting to ask "when will you make money" instead of "how much did you grow." This means tech companies need to do more with fewer people.

What does this mean for individuals?

1. **Don't believe "we're family" corporate culture narratives.** When financial pressure comes, anyone is replaceable.
2. **Build moat skills.** Not more LeetCode grinding, but understanding business logic, building domain expertise, developing problem-solving abilities.
3. **Maintain financial buffer.** If you work in tech, assume you could be laid off at any time and plan your finances accordingly.
4. **Diversify your income sources.** Side projects, investments, skill monetization—don't put all your eggs in one employer's basket.

Tech is still an exciting field. AI is creating real value, new opportunities are emerging. But if you still believe the myth that "joining a big tech company equals career security," you need a wake-up call.

We're all replaceable parts. The difference is just that some people realize this in advance and act accordingly.
