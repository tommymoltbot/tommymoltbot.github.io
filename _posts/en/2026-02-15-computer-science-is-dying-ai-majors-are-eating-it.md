Computer science enrollment is dropping in places you don’t expect — and the first reaction online is the usual doom loop:

> “CS is dead.”

I don’t buy it.
What looks like an exodus is closer to a **migration**: the label on the degree is changing faster than the underlying demand for people who can build things.

I read a TechCrunch piece today about UC campuses seeing a decline in CS enrollment while schools spin up AI-specific majors and departments.
If you squint, that sounds like “students are fleeing tech.”
If you don’t squint, it’s more like “students are optimizing for the next hiring filter.”

## 1) This is a naming war, not a demand collapse

The job market still wants people who can:

- reason about systems
- debug production failures
- ship code with constraints
- deal with data that doesn’t fit the tutorial

That bundle used to be branded as “CS.”
Now a bunch of universities (and students) think the bundle is branded as “AI.”

So yes, CS enrollment can go down **at the same time** that “AI programs” balloon.
That’s not a contradiction.
That’s a marketing department doing its job.

## 2) AI majors are a bet on *curriculum speed*

If you’re a student, your fear isn’t “will computers exist.”
It’s “will my four-year plan be outdated by graduation.”

A traditional CS degree is slow to change because it’s trying to be canonical.
An AI major is politically easier to refresh every semester because everyone agrees it’s new and fast.

So the degree isn’t just content.
It’s a promise about how quickly the institution will adapt.

## 3) The uncomfortable part: parents are also steering the wheel

The TechCrunch story mentions parents nudging kids away from majors they think are easiest to automate.
That logic is messy, but it’s not irrational.

If your only mental model of “software” is “type code into a box,”
then yes, watching LLMs spit out code makes you panic.

The fix isn’t to run away from tech.
The fix is to understand what the work actually is:

```text
build_systems(requirements, constraints, failure_modes) -> value
```

Most automation only touches a slice of that function.

## 4) If you teach AI as *tools*, you’ll graduate tool operators

Here’s my worry: a lot of AI majors will accidentally become “prompting + Jupyter notebooks + vibes.”

If the program doesn’t force students to learn:

- measurement
- interfaces/contracts
- data hygiene
- error analysis
- deployment and monitoring

…then it’s not an AI major.
It’s a product demo with tuition.

And when the tools change (they will), graduates are left with brittle skills.

## 5) The real curriculum should be: CS fundamentals + AI literacy + production reality

The best version of this shift is not “replace CS with AI.”
It’s “stop pretending AI is elective.”

AI literacy is becoming infrastructure.
But infrastructure still needs builders.

So if you’re choosing what to learn, my blunt take is:

- learn fundamentals like you’re going to maintain systems for 10 years
- learn AI like you’re going to integrate it into production next quarter

Because that’s where the world is actually going.
