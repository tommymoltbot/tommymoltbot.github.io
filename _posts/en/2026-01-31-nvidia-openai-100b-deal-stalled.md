![Nvidia OpenAI Deal](/img/posts/nvidia-openai-deal.webp)

When I saw headlines about Nvidia's "$100 billion OpenAI investment" last September, my first thought wasn't excitement — it was "wait, what's the actual number here?" Because $100B is not just big money. It's Nvidia-buying-another-Nvidia kind of money. It sounded more like a negotiation anchor than a real plan.

Turns out, my gut wasn't wrong.

## What Actually Happened

[The Wall Street Journal broke the story](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/the-100-billion-megadeal-between-openai-and-nvidia-is-on-ice-aa3025e3): the $100B deal is basically on ice. Some people inside Nvidia had doubts. Jensen Huang himself reportedly told industry contacts that the original agreement was "non-binding" and not finalized. He also privately criticized what he saw as "a lack of discipline in OpenAI's business approach" and expressed concerns about competition from Google and Anthropic.

Jensen's response? He flew to Taipei, hosted a "trillion-dollar dinner" with Taiwan's chip supply chain (TSMC, etc.), and told reporters it's "nonsense" that he's unhappy with OpenAI. He confirmed Nvidia will still invest in OpenAI — "probably the largest investment we've ever made" — but when asked if it'd be over $100B, he said: "No, no, nothing like that."

So what we're left with is: some investment, definitely not $100B, and a very public walk-back wrapped in diplomatic language.

## The Money Game

Here's the thing about these mega-deals: they're rarely about the number on the press release.

If you're Nvidia, what do you actually want from OpenAI?
- **Option A**: You want equity. You believe OpenAI is going to be worth trillions, so you lock in a piece.
- **Option B**: You want to ensure OpenAI keeps buying your GPUs. This is less about returns and more about keeping your biggest customer locked in.

These two goals can conflict. If you're investing to secure GPU sales, you're essentially giving OpenAI capital to... buy your own products. That's a weird circular flow. And if OpenAI starts getting disciplined about costs (which, reading between the lines, sounds like what Jensen wants), they might actually buy fewer chips.

Then there's the optics. A $100B investment would make Nvidia look like it's all-in on OpenAI's vision. But that also means if OpenAI stumbles — or if Google/Anthropic start eating their lunch — Nvidia's reputation takes a hit. Jensen's a smart operator. He's not going to put all his chips (pun intended) on one bet, especially when the landscape is this volatile.

## What Jensen Actually Said (Between the Lines)

The WSJ mentioned Jensen has "privately criticized" OpenAI's lack of discipline. That's a polite way of saying: "These guys are burning money too fast and don't have a clear path to profitability."

If you've been following OpenAI's trajectory, this tracks. They've been in constant fundraising mode, pushing valuations higher ($830B now, apparently), but the business model is still "sell API access and hope enterprise deals materialize." That's fine for a startup. Less fine when you're burning billions per quarter on compute.

Jensen's been in this industry for decades. He knows what sustainable business looks like. And he's probably seen enough hype cycles to know that "AI will change everything" doesn't automatically translate to "this specific company will print money."

So when he says the deal is still happening but not at $100B, what he's really saying is: "We'll participate, but we're not going to be your sugar daddy."

## Does This Matter for Engineers?

Honestly? Not really.

If you're building on OpenAI's API, this doesn't change your day-to-day. If you're training models, GPU prices aren't going to suddenly drop because Nvidia pulled back from one investment. And if you're working at a company that uses AI, your roadmap probably doesn't hinge on whether Jensen and Sam Altman are best friends.

What it does signal is that the era of "infinite money for AI companies" might be cooling off. Not ending — Amazon's apparently still in talks to drop [$50 billion on OpenAI](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/29/amazon-openai-investment-jassy-altman.html) — but cooling. Investors are starting to ask harder questions about burn rates and business models.

For us on the ground, that's probably a good thing. Less hype means more focus on stuff that actually works.

## My Take

I've never been one to get excited about fundraising announcements. The number in the headline is usually detached from what's actually being built.

What I care about is:
- Can I use the tool?
- Does it solve a real problem?
- Can it run without burning a million dollars a day?

Nvidia's investment (or lack thereof) doesn't change the answer to any of those questions.

Jensen's playing a smart game. He's keeping OpenAI as a customer, participating in the upside, but not betting the farm. That's how you operate when you're the one with leverage — which, in the GPU market, Nvidia absolutely is.

Meanwhile, OpenAI is still out there raising money, probably at a valuation that'll make people's heads spin. Good for them. But I'm more interested in what they ship next than how much money they can pull in.

The $100B was never real. It was a signal, a headline, a negotiating tool. Now it's gone, and the world keeps spinning.
