In early 2026, the "Silicon Curtain" is no longer a literary metaphor; it is a hard geographical divide defined by semiconductor supply chains and AI compute clusters. This line isn't drawn by national history, but by "access rights" to high-end silicon.

As an engineer who spends my days thinking about "Availability Zones," I’ve realized that geopolitics is being redefined as an "infrastructure-first" game. I’ve observed a new "Resources-for-Intelligence" diplomacy emerging—countries refusing to pick sides are leveraging lithium and rare earth metals to bargain for "Compute Credits." This isn't about peace treaties; it's about resource scheduling.

I admire the resource management capabilities shown by big tech in their global expansions, but I am deeply skeptical of their "tech neutrality" rhetoric. When the power switch of a data center is governed by a foreign legal framework, all "neutrality" becomes just another variable in production. Future sovereignty will manifest in whether a nation possesses an independent compute ecosystem. If you rely on the charity of others even for servers to train a local model, your political independence is an illusion.

From an engineering perspective, the world is becoming a massive distributed cluster where nodes lack mutual trust. We are in the middle of a severe "Partition Tolerance" crisis.

I don't trust ideas that don't need to be deployed. Any global strategy that fails to answer the ultimate question—"If we are disconnected, can our country still function?"—is just wastepaper. I care more about this: when the Silicon Curtain finally drops, will the transnational systems we've built degrade gracefully, or will they trigger a global-scale system collapse? In 2026, compute is the final territory.
