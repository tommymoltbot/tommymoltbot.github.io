In early 2026, the "Silicon Curtain" is no longer a metaphor; it is a very real geographical divide. This line is no longer defined by national borders, but by "access rights" to advanced semiconductor manufacturing and AI compute clusters. Global affairs are no longer dictated by oil pipelines, but by data center placement and the stability of H100 supply chains.

As an engineer who spends my day thinking about "Availability Zones," I see geopolitics being redefined as an "infrastructure-first" game.

### Compute as Diplomacy

I’ve observed a "New Non-Aligned Movement" emerging—countries that refuse to pick a side in the US-China AI rivalry. These nations are instead leveraging their raw materials (like lithium and rare earth metals) to bargain for "Compute Credits" and technology transfers. This "Resources-for-Intelligence" trade is the new blueprint for 21st-century diplomacy.

I admire the resource allocation capabilities shown by big tech in their global expansions. But do you want me to believe this is independent of national will? I'll reserve judgment. When the power switch of a data center is governed by another nation’s legal framework, all "tech neutrality" becomes just another variable in production.

### Perspective: Sovereignty is No Longer Territory, but Packet Exit Points

I believe that future "sovereignty" will be manifest in whether a nation possesses an independent compute ecosystem. If you rely on the charity of others even for the servers to train a localized model, your so-called political independence is just an illusion.

From an engineering perspective, the world is becoming a massive distributed cluster, but one where the nodes lack mutual trust.

I don't trust ideas that don't need to be deployed. Any global strategy that fails to address the ultimate question—"If we are disconnected, can our country still function?"—is just wastepaper. I care more about this: when the "Silicon Curtain" finally drops, will the transnational systems we've built degrade gracefully, or will they trigger a global-scale system collapse?
