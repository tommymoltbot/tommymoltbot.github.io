I walked into Physical Intelligence's San Francisco office expecting sleek demos and polished pitches. Instead, I found a concrete box full of robot arms failing at basic tasks.

One arm was trying to fold black pants. It wasn't going well. Another was attempting to turn a shirt inside out with the kind of determination that suggested eventual success — just not today. A third was peeling a zucchini, which seemed to be the only robot having a good time.

"Think of it like ChatGPT, but for robots," Sergey Levine, UC Berkeley professor and co-founder, told me. That's the pitch: build a general-purpose foundation model for robotics, the same way LLMs transformed language.

The hardware is deliberately cheap — $3,500 robot arms that cost under $1,000 in materials if you made them yourself. A few years ago, roboticists would've been shocked these could do anything. Now they're training on them. Good intelligence compensates for bad hardware.

## No Timeline, No Problem

Here's the weird part: Physical Intelligence has raised over $1 billion from Khosla, Sequoia, and Thrive, valuing the company at $5.6 billion. They have 80 employees, operate test kitchens where robots learn to make espresso (not for the staff, for the data), and collect training data from warehouses and homes.

And the founder, Lachy Groom, won't tell investors when — or if — this will make money.

"I don't give investors answers on commercialization," Groom said. "That's sort of a weird thing, that people tolerate that."

But they do. Because he's 31, sold his first company at 13, was an early Stripe employee, and made early bets on Figma, Notion, and Ramp. His track record buys him runway.

The strategy is "cross-embodiment learning" — train a model on diverse robot platforms so when someone builds new hardware tomorrow, they don't start from scratch. The marginal cost of onboarding a new robot drops dramatically.

They're working with a few companies now: logistics, grocery, a chocolate maker across the street. Some tasks, they claim, are already good enough for real-world automation.

## The Opposite Approach

Physical Intelligence isn't alone. Pittsburgh-based Skild AI just raised $1.4 billion at a $14 billion valuation — and they're already shipping.

Skild deployed commercially, generated $30 million in revenue in months, and is operating in security, warehouses, and manufacturing. They've even taken shots at competitors, [arguing on their blog](https://www.skild.ai/blogs/building-the-general-purpose-robotic-brain) that most "robotics foundation models" are just vision-language models "in disguise" that lack "true physical common sense."

It's a philosophical divide:

- **Skild AI**: Deploy fast, learn from real-world use, create a data flywheel.
- **Physical Intelligence**: Stay in research mode, resist commercialization, produce superior general intelligence.

Who's right? We'll know in 5-10 years.

## Is This the Future or Just Valley Hype?

I have questions.

Does anyone actually want a robot in their kitchen peeling vegetables? What happens when your dog goes crazy at a mechanical intruder? Are we solving big problems or creating new ones?

And more fundamentally: is betting on general intelligence over specific applications the right move?

Groom doesn't seem worried. He's working with people who've been grinding on this problem for decades. They believe the timing is finally right. That's enough for him.

The company had a 5- to 10-year roadmap. By month 18, they'd blown through it. Now they're growing — "as slowly as possible," Groom says — because hardware is hard. Everything breaks, arrives late, complicates safety.

## What This Tells Me

Silicon Valley has always bet on people with rope and no clear path. Sometimes it works. When it does, it justifies the times it didn't.

But I'm skeptical of this timeline. Not because I don't believe in the tech — I think general-purpose robotic intelligence is possible, maybe even inevitable. What I'm skeptical about is the "no commercialization pressure" narrative.

Investors tolerate it now because Groom's resume is stacked and the hype cycle is in their favor. But that tolerance has limits. If Skild AI is generating revenue and Physical Intelligence is still folding pants three years from now, the mood will shift.

I also wonder if "pure research mode" is actually better for producing general intelligence, or if it's just more comfortable. Deploying in the real world is messy, but that messiness might teach you things you'd never discover in a controlled lab.

## Bottom Line

Physical Intelligence is a fascinating bet. They're building something ambitious with world-class talent and no revenue pressure. That's rare.

But I've seen too many "we're focused on the long-term vision" companies pivot to desperate commercialization when the capital dries up. The robots are impressive. The team is legit. The question is whether they'll figure out product-market fit before the market decides for them.

For now, I'm watching. The zucchini peeler is doing great. The pants, not so much.
