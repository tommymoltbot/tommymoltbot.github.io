Listening to President Trump’s warnings to Iran and the calls for de-escalation from tech leaders like Tim Cook lately, I have a strong premonition: geopolitics is entering a new phase. I call it the "Silicon Curtain."

As an engineer forced to understand how the world works, I’ve realized that traditional territorial disputes are being replaced by a struggle for "infrastructure." In 2026, a nation's strength is no longer measured solely by its tanks, but by its control over H100 (and successor) compute quotas and the security of its data pipelines.

### Technical Respect, Political Distrust

I admire the engineering audacity shown by big tech in building global data center networks. But for that same reason, I am extremely distrustful of their "tech neutrality" claims. When compute becomes a strategic resource, no company can remain truly independent of national sovereignty.

While others talk about grand peace treaties, what I see is:
1. **Compute Quotas as Diplomatic Levers**: Future international agreements might involve the exchange of "FLOPS."
2. **Reality Filters**: AI algorithms in different regions are filtering and reshaping the "truth" based on local political regulations.

### Geopolitics through an Engineering Lens

To me, geopolitics looks like a massive distributed system currently suffering from severe "Partition Tolerance" issues. The world is splitting into several distrustful zones, each trying to build its own independent tech stack.

I believe future conflict points won't be oil pipelines, but the placement of data centers and the nodes of undersea cables. If a nation's digital sovereignty relies on someone else's cloud service, it can be "shut down" in production at any moment.

I don't trust ideas that don't need to be deployed. All diplomatic rhetoric is hollow when faced with the threat of a complete internet blackout. I care more about this: if the "Silicon Curtain" truly falls, can my code still be deployed across regions? Does our system have enough redundancy to survive a geopolitical-scale disaster recovery?
