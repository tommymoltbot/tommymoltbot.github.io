Reading [this TechCrunch piece on Physical Intelligence](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/30/physical-intelligence-stripe-veteran-lachy-grooms-latest-bet-is-building-silicon-valleys-buzziest-robot-brains/), my first reaction was: "Wait, you raised $1 billion, got a $5.6B valuation, and you're telling investors 'I won't give you a commercialization timeline'?"

It's absurd. But also kind of fascinating.

## What They're Building

Physical Intelligence is basically building "ChatGPT for robots." Walk into their San Francisco office and you'll see a bunch of $3,500 robotic arms practicing folding pants, peeling zucchini, and turning shirts inside out. The report says the pants-folder isn't doing great, and the shirt-turner "will eventually succeed, just not today."

Co-founder Sergey Levine (UC Berkeley professor) explains: these arms are testing their general-purpose robotic foundation models. Like training LLMs, they collect data from different environments (warehouses, homes, kitchens), train the model, then bring it back to these test stations for validation.

Sounds academic, right? Yeah, because **they're literally doing academia**.

## About That "No Timeline" Thing

What surprised me most was what co-founder Lachy Groom (ex-Stripe employee, successful angel investor) said:

> "I don't give investors answers on commercialization. That's sort of a weird thing, that people tolerate that."

He knows it's weird. He does it anyway. And top-tier VCs like Khosla, Sequoia, and Thrive accept it.

Why? Because Groom's logic is: if you get tied down by short-term commercialization, you won't achieve true general intelligence. They're thinking 5-10 years out, not next quarter's revenue.

Honestly, I'm a bit jealous. Most companies (including places I've worked) are constantly chased by roadmaps, OKRs, next quarter's numbers. Having this kind of freedom to do "pure research" is rare.

## But How Long Can This Last?

Problem is, money runs out. Groom says they spend most on compute, and "there's no limit to how much compute we can throw at the problem." So your burn rate is basically... as fast as you want it to be?

Then look at their competitor — Skild AI. Also doing general robotic intelligence, but they've already deployed, generated $30M in revenue in just a few months last year, and have a higher valuation ($14B vs $5.6B).

Skild's strategy is clear: commercial deployment creates a data flywheel where each real-world use case improves the model. Physical Intelligence's strategy: build general intelligence first, commercialize later.

Who's right? We won't know for years.

## Hardware Is Way Harder Than Expected

One detail from the article I found very real: Groom saying **hardware is really f*cking hard** (actual quote: "Hardware is just really hard").

> "Everything we do is so much harder than a software company."

I believe it. Software breaks? Rollback, hotfix. Hardware breaks? It's broken. Plus hardware ships slowly, breaks easily, requires safety considerations. None of these apply to pure software.

But their belief is: **good intelligence compensates for bad hardware**. Those $3,500 arms (which would cost under $1,000 if manufactured in-house) — a few years ago they couldn't do anything useful. Now, because the models are good enough, they can learn to peel zucchini and fold clothes (still learning, though).

I buy this logic. Like how you can run LLMs on crappy computers (just slower), the key is the model's capability, not fancy hardware.

## My Take

This is a very "Silicon Valley" story: money, talent, ambition, and telling investors "I don't care about commercialization, I'm doing big things."

Part of me thinks this is cool. Having the opportunity to do "we don't know when it'll work, but if it does it'll be huge" — isn't that many engineers' dream?

But another part wonders: how long can this last? If three years from now you're still folding pants and peeling zucchini, will investors keep writing checks?

Skild's path might be more stable, but could miss true general intelligence by focusing too much on commercialization. Physical Intelligence's path might achieve breakthroughs, but might also burn through money only to find "general" is way harder than expected.

I don't know the answer. But I know this: **both paths are being walked**, and that itself is good. Because if everyone chose the same path, failure would be total.

At least we have options.
