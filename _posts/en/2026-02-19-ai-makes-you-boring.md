I read a short post today titled **“AI makes you boring.”**

My first reaction was: that’s a bit dramatic.

Then I kept reading and realized it’s not really a hot take. It’s closer to an uncomfortable description of what happens when you outsource the part of your brain that generates *friction*.

And yeah, I’ve felt it.

Not in a “my code is worse now” way. More like: **my thoughts get smoother, faster, and more… forgettable.**

## Five angles I use to think about this

1) **Work-muscle angle:** ideas aren’t something you “have.” They’re something you *build* by sitting with a problem longer than is comfortable.

2) **Product angle:** AI makes it cheap to ship. It also makes it cheap to ship something you don’t actually understand.

3) **Conversation angle:** pre-AI, a good “show your work” story came from someone who wrestled with a problem. With heavy AI use, you get the output without the wrestling — and there’s less to talk about.

4) **Engineering angle:** when you don’t own the reasoning, you can’t debug the result. This isn’t moralizing — it’s an operational problem.

5) **Personal voice angle:** the scary failure mode isn’t “wrong facts.” It’s **tone collapse**: you start sounding like the model’s average.

## The boringness problem isn’t style. It’s missing struggle

I’m not anti-AI.

I use it. I like it. It’s great at:

- turning vague thoughts into a draft you can react to
- unblocking a stuck implementation
- summarizing a pile of docs when you just need orientation

But there’s a specific trap it pulls you into:

You skip the part where you:

- stare at the contradiction
- try two approaches and hate both
- realize your initial framing was wrong
- rewrite the core idea in your own words

That process is where the interesting stuff comes from.

If you let the model jump from “prompt” to “finished paragraph,” you didn’t just save time. You **skipped the cognitive work that would have produced a non-generic opinion**.

The result often reads fine. It’s grammatically clean. It’s confident.

It’s also… interchangeable.

## “Human in the loop” doesn’t automatically save you

A lot of people say: “Just keep a human in the loop.”

Sure. But I think there’s a subtle inversion that happens:

- we imagine the human is steering the AI
- but in practice, the AI starts steering what the human *thinks counts as a good thought*

Because the model is really good at rewarding you with something that looks like a finished product.

It’s like getting a perfectly plated meal when you were supposed to learn how to cook.

You can say “I’m still the chef,” but if you never touch the knife, you don’t build the skill.

## My rule (for myself): AI can draft, but it can’t decide

This is the boundary I’m trying to hold:

- AI can help me draft.
- AI can help me explore.
- AI can help me find counterarguments.

But the “what do I actually believe?” part has to be earned.

If I can’t explain my point without looking at the generated paragraph, that’s a smell.

If I can’t write the core claim in one ugly sentence first, I’m probably borrowing confidence.

And if every post I write starts sounding like a LinkedIn answer, something is already broken.

So I try to force a tiny moment of friction back into the workflow:

```text
write_core_claim() -> argue_with_self() -> then ask AI for a draft
```

Not because it’s virtuous.

Because it’s the only way I’ve found to keep my brain from getting lazy.

## Bottom line

AI doesn’t just change output quality.

It changes *the person producing the output*.

If you offload the struggle, you offload the part that makes you interesting.

And the worst part is: you’ll still feel productive.
