There's a lawsuit claiming Meta can "access virtually all of WhatsApp users' purportedly 'private' communications," despite the app's end-to-end encryption promises.

Sounds scary, right? But before you delete WhatsApp, let me tell you who's behind this lawsuit.

## The Background Is... Interesting

The law firm filing the lawsuit is Quinn Emanuel. This same firm is currently representing NSO Group in an appeal.

Who's NSO Group? The Israeli company that makes Pegasus spyware. Last year, a US federal court ordered them to pay WhatsApp $167 million for using Pegasus to target over 1,400 WhatsApp users, including journalists and government officials.

Now the lawyers defending NSO Group are suddenly suing WhatsApp, claiming Meta can read users' messages.

You think that's a coincidence?

## Meta's Response Is Blunt

Meta's response is basically: "This is absurd, and you're just trying to whitewash NSO Group."

They're pursuing sanctions against Quinn Emanuel for filing what they call a "meritless lawsuit designed purely to grab headlines."

Quinn Emanuel's counter? "Our defense of NSO has nothing to do with this case. And notice that Meta's denials are carefully worded—they don't directly deny having the *ability* to read WhatsApp messages."

## Is It Technically Possible?

I asked some friends who work on encryption. Their reaction? "If end-to-end encryption is implemented correctly, it's mathematically impossible for a middleman to read the messages."

Steven Murdoch, a professor of security engineering at UCL, said it more directly: the claim is "a mathematical impossibility."

If WhatsApp really had a backdoor, how could they keep it secret with thousands of employees? Someone would have leaked it by now.

## But I Don't Fully Trust Meta Either

While I don't believe WhatsApp can read message content, that doesn't make Meta the good guy.

Their metadata collection is already invasive enough: your profile info, contact lists, who you talk to, and when. They can't see the content, but this metadata alone reveals a lot.

A tech industry executive told The Guardian: "WhatsApp's vaunted privacy leaves much to be desired." I agree.

End-to-end encryption protects message content. It doesn't protect your behavioral patterns.

## So What's Really Going On?

My take:

1. **Technically, WhatsApp probably can't read messages**: Unless they built a backdoor, but that's too risky to hide
2. **This lawsuit is likely strategic**: The timing is too convenient—the same firm defending NSO Group suddenly sues Meta
3. **Meta isn't innocent, but this specific claim seems false**: They violate privacy in other ways, but that doesn't make this allegation true
4. **The whistleblowers' credibility is questionable**: They claim there are "courageous" anonymous sources from five countries, but no evidence

## Will I Keep Using WhatsApp?

Yes. Not because I trust Meta, but because:

1. End-to-end encryption is still better than Telegram's "only encrypted to the server" approach
2. There's no perfect messaging app, only relatively better choices
3. If you really care about privacy, use Signal—but most people won't switch platforms for that

The case is ongoing, and I'll keep watching. But until there's actual evidence, I'm not panicking over a lawyer's press release.

Technical questions require technical evidence, not whoever has better PR.
