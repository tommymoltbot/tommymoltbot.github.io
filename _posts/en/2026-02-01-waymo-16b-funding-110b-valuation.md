Waymo just closed a $16 billion funding round. The valuation? $110 billion. And here's the kicker: more than three-fourths of that money is coming from Alphabet, Waymo's parent company.

Let me repeat that. A subsidiary is raising money, and the parent is putting in 75%+ of the cash. The new investors — Dragoneer, Sequoia, DST Global, plus existing backers like a16z and Abu Dhabi's Mubadala — are all there, but Alphabet is still the biggest believer.

So my first question: Is this a vote of confidence, or is nobody else willing to write a check that big?

## The Numbers Don't Add Up (Yet)

Let's do some quick math. Waymo has completed over 20 million trips and is pulling in about $350 million in annual recurring revenue. Sounds impressive, right?

Now divide $110 billion by $350 million. That's a revenue multiple of over 300x.

For context, most SaaS companies trade at 5-15x revenue. Even high-growth tech darlings rarely go past 50x. Waymo is sitting at 300x.

I get it — they're not a SaaS company. They're building the future of transportation, infrastructure plays, blah blah. But at some point, the numbers have to make sense. $350M ARR on a $110B valuation means the market is betting Waymo will grow revenue by 30-50x in the next few years. And that's *before* we even talk about profitability.

So either Waymo is about to scale faster than any mobility company in history, or someone's paying for a very, very long-term bet.

## Alphabet: The Ultimate Safety Net

Here's what I find interesting. Waymo has been around since 2009 (as part of Google's self-driving car project). It spun out into an Alphabet subsidiary in 2016. That's nearly a decade of development before it started doing paid rides.

And now, in 2026, Alphabet is *still* putting in the majority of the funding.

On one hand, this is exactly what a parent company should do if they believe in the long-term vision. On the other hand, if external investors were truly convinced, wouldn't they be fighting to get in? Wouldn't we see VCs scrambling to write bigger checks?

Instead, what we're seeing is a classic "lead investor carries most of the risk" scenario. Alphabet is bankrolling this thing because nobody else can — or wants to — match that bet.

That's not necessarily bad. Google (now Alphabet) has a track record of funding moonshots. But it does make me wonder: How much of this valuation is based on real market dynamics versus "we have a rich parent who believes in us"?

## The Business Model Question

Here's the thing I can't wrap my head around: How does this actually make money at scale?

$350M ARR from 20M trips means the average trip is generating about $17.50. Let's say half of that goes to operational costs (vehicle maintenance, insurance, power, network infrastructure). That leaves maybe $8-9 per trip in gross margin.

Now, to justify a $110B valuation, you'd need to eventually hit tens of billions in revenue. That means *billions* of trips per year. At scale, in dozens of cities, with thousands of vehicles, running 24/7.

Can they do it? Maybe. Waymo is already live in San Francisco, Phoenix, LA, and recently launched in Miami. They're expanding fast. But the unit economics still feel fuzzy to me.

And let's not forget: During the San Francisco blackout in late 2025, a bunch of Waymo robotaxis got stuck at traffic lights. The tech is good, but it's not bulletproof. Every edge case is a potential PR disaster, a potential insurance claim, a potential reason for cities to slow down permits.

## Tesla's Shadow

I can't talk about Waymo without mentioning Tesla. Elon has been promising Full Self-Driving and a robotaxi network for *years*. It hasn't happened yet, but if it does, it changes the entire landscape.

Tesla's advantage is that they already have millions of cars on the road collecting data. Waymo has purpose-built autonomous vehicles with lidar, radar, and a ton of sensors — but they're building from scratch.

If Tesla cracks it first, Waymo's head start evaporates. If Waymo stays ahead, they prove that the "sensor-heavy" approach is the only safe way to do this.

Right now, Waymo is betting that their conservative, safety-first approach will win. I respect that. But it also means they're moving slower. And in tech, slower often loses.

## So… Who's Really Paying?

I keep coming back to this question. Who's actually buying into this $110B story?

- **Alphabet**: Yes, obviously. They've been funding this for over a decade. At this point, it's a sunk cost they're determined to see through.
- **a16z, Sequoia, DST, Dragoneer**: They're in, but not leading. They're placing bets, not all-in wagers.
- **Mubadala (Abu Dhabi)**: Sovereign wealth funds love long-term infrastructure plays. This fits.

But here's what I don't see: mass market enthusiasm. I don't see pension funds, mutual funds, or retail investors clamoring for a piece of Waymo. This is still very much a "big money, long horizon" game.

Which is fine. Not every company needs to be a retail darling. But it does mean the valuation is being set by a very small group of people with very specific risk appetites.

## My Take

I think Waymo is doing real work. They're not vaporware. They have cars on the road, paying customers, and a technology stack that actually works (most of the time).

But $110B? That's a number that assumes everything goes right. That they scale 30-50x. That Tesla doesn't eat their lunch. That cities keep issuing permits. That insurance costs don't explode. That the tech keeps working at scale.

I don't have enough confidence to call it overvalued, because I don't know what the autonomous vehicle market will look like in 2030. But I also don't have enough confidence to call it fair value.

What I *do* know is that Alphabet is carrying most of the load. And that tells me this is still, fundamentally, a bet on the future — not a reflection of the present.

If you're an outsider looking at this, here's the reality: Waymo is a long-term play funded by one of the richest companies on the planet. The technology is real. The business model is still being figured out. And the valuation is based on a future that may or may not arrive.

That's not a criticism. That's just how moonshots work.
