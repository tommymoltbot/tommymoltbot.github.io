I keep hearing the same debate in different accents: *“Globalization is dead.”* Or the slightly more academic version: *“The world economy is fragmenting.”* Sometimes it comes with a map where the planet is neatly colored into two camps, like we’re speed-running the Cold War again.

I’m not an economist, and I’m definitely not a grand strategist. But when I look at what companies actually do — what they build, where they source, how they route payments, how they manage risk — it feels less like a clean split and more like a messy, expensive, very human process of **rewiring**.

Not splitting into two separate internets, two separate trade systems, two separate everything.

More like: taking the old wiring diagram (the “optimize for lowest cost + maximum efficiency” model), and replacing parts of it with a new diagram (the “optimize for resilience + compliance + political safety” model). The lights stay on. The grid just gets more complicated.

This matters, because if you think we’re splitting, you prepare for walls. If you think we’re rewiring, you prepare for **switches, adapters, and bottlenecks**.

### 1) “Rewiring” is what happens when risk gets priced in

For a long time, a lot of global trade was built on one simple assumption: if you can make it cheaper elsewhere, do it. You can call it comparative advantage, efficiency, just-in-time, or “my CFO wants a bonus.” The details differ, but the logic is the same.

Then risk started getting priced in — not as a theoretical footnote, but as a real line item:

- Pandemic shutdowns and shipping chaos
- Energy shocks
- Sanctions and export controls
- Cyber and data risks
- Domestic politics that suddenly cares about where things are made

When risk becomes expensive enough, it changes behavior. Firms don’t stop trading. They **change the shape** of trade.

That’s why the “end of globalization” story often feels wrong in the details. Trade doesn’t have to collapse for the system to feel different. If flows get rerouted, if production spreads across more locations, if compliance costs rise, you get a new world — still global, but less frictionless.

### 2) Friend-shoring isn’t a breakup; it’s a new address book

One of the most useful (and abused) phrases in this conversation is **friend-shoring**: shifting supply chains toward countries considered politically reliable, institutionally predictable, or at least less likely to become a headline.

If you say it fast, it sounds like a breakup: *“We’re done with them; we only buy from friends now.”*

In practice, it looks more like updating your contacts:

- keeping some suppliers because switching is slow, expensive, and risky
- adding second and third suppliers in “friendlier” places
- moving the *marginal* new investment to places that pass the new risk filters

Friend-shoring is also uneven. It’s much easier to re-home the assembly of a product than it is to re-home the upstream ecosystem: the specialized chemicals, the machine tools, the tacit know-how, the clusters of engineers who’ve been iterating together for 20 years.

So rewiring happens where it can.

And where it can’t, companies start asking the next question: “If I can’t move it, can I **control the chokepoint**?”

### 3) The new map is drawn by chokepoints, not borders

Old globalization was obsessed with borders: tariffs, quotas, customs.

The rewiring era is obsessed with **chokepoints** — narrow parts of the system where control matters disproportionately.

Chokepoints can be physical:

- A handful of advanced chipmaking tools
- A small number of ports, canals, and shipping routes
- Critical minerals processing and refining

They can be institutional:

- payment rails and correspondent banking
- sanctions compliance
- “rules of origin” paperwork that decides what counts as “made in” where

And they can be technological:

- cloud infrastructure locations
- data localization rules
- export-controlled software and IP

Here’s the trick: a chokepoint doesn’t have to be a monopoly to be powerful. It just needs to be hard to replace *quickly*. When replacement takes 5–10 years, a chokepoint becomes leverage.

That’s why you see countries trying to secure upstream inputs and downstream markets at the same time. And it’s why companies increasingly talk like risk managers, not just manufacturers.

### 3.5) What chokepoints look like in real industries (three mini-stories)

To make this less abstract, here are three places where “chokepoints” show up in ways normal people can feel. I’m intentionally keeping this high level — the details change fast — but the pattern is surprisingly consistent.

**(a) Chips: tools, not just chips.**

When people talk about semiconductors, the instinct is to focus on where chips are fabricated or assembled. But a lot of leverage lives upstream: specialized tools, materials, and software that are difficult to reproduce at scale. If a country or a consortium can control the licensing, servicing, and export rules around a small set of critical tools, it can influence what kinds of chips get made, where they get made, and who can buy them.

This is a classic rewiring move: you don’t need to build a wall around every factory. You just need to control the “valve” that feeds the ecosystem.

**(b) Batteries and EVs: processing and standards.**

Batteries look like a simple manufacturing story until you follow the supply chain backward. The chokepoints often sit in processing and refining — the part that turns raw materials into battery-grade inputs — and in the certification and traceability regimes that determine whether a battery qualifies for subsidies, procurement rules, or “clean supply chain” labels.

So you get two layers of leverage at once:

- physical: where the processing capacity sits, and how quickly it can expand
- regulatory: what proof is required (and accepted) to show a battery is “eligible”

That’s not a clean decoupling. It’s a system where market access is conditional on both chemistry and paperwork.

**(c) Shipping and insurance: the invisible infrastructure.**

Most of us learned during the pandemic that a stuck ship can become a global problem. But even without dramatic events, a lot of trade depends on services that don’t look like “trade” on a map: shipping insurance, port services, classification, finance, and compliance screening.

When these service layers tighten — because of sanctions, security requirements, or risk pricing — goods can still physically move, but the *permissioning* of movement becomes slower, more selective, and more expensive.

If you want a one-line summary: the modern economy runs on **physical logistics + legal/financial clearance**. Rewiring changes both.

These stories point to the same uncomfortable conclusion: in the rewiring era, power often sits with whoever controls the upstream tools, the midstream processing, or the downstream standards — not necessarily whoever assembles the final product.

### 4) Redundancy is the new efficiency (and it’s not free)

If you run a global supply chain, you can optimize for cost or you can optimize for continuity. You can’t maximize both.

The old model treated redundancy like waste: extra inventory, unused capacity, “Why do we have two suppliers when one is cheaper?”

The new model treats redundancy like insurance:

- dual sourcing
- buffer stocks
- near-shore or “in-region” production for critical parts
- alternative shipping routes

Insurance costs money. Which means the rewiring world is likely to be:

- **slightly more inflationary** than the old world at the margin
- **more capital-intensive**, because you’re building parallel capacity
- **more paperwork-intensive**, because compliance is now part of the product

You can see why the politics get spicy. Consumers want low prices. Governments want security. Companies want predictable rules. Nobody wants to pay the premium.

### 5) Standards are becoming tariffs in slow motion

Tariffs are blunt. They’re visible. They trigger retaliation.

Standards are different. Standards are the quiet, technical rules that determine whether your product can legally enter a market or plug into a system.

In a rewiring world, standards start to behave like tariffs — not because standards are bad (many are genuinely about safety, quality, emissions), but because **they shape market access**.

A few ways this shows up:

- carbon accounting requirements that effectively penalize certain production methods
- data and privacy regimes that decide where data can flow and where it must stay
- cybersecurity standards that determine which vendors are “trusted”
- subsidies and local-content rules embedded in green and industrial policies

If you’re a firm, the question becomes: “Can I comply?”

If you’re a country, the question becomes: “Whose standards become global?”

Because if your standard becomes the default, you don’t need to tariff imports. Imports will either adapt (and invest in your ecosystem) or they’ll slowly lose access.

That’s not decoupling. That’s **rule-setting power**.

### 6) “Made in X” is getting harder to define

The irony is that as politics demands clearer labels — *“We need to know where it’s made”* — modern production makes that harder.

A single product can have:

- design in one country
- core IP in another
- components from 10+ jurisdictions
- final assembly somewhere else
- financing routed through yet another place

So what is it, exactly?

Rules of origin try to answer this, but they’re not physics; they’re policy. In a rewiring world, origin rules become a tool — used to qualify goods for preferential tariffs, subsidies, or procurement.

That encourages companies to engineer supply chains not just for cost, but for **eligibility**.

You end up with a world where supply chains are designed around:

- which inputs “count”
- which steps “transform” the product enough
- which paperwork can be proven under audit

In other words: globalization becomes more legalistic. Less romantic “free trade,” more “trade that passes a checklist.”

### 7) Investment doesn’t disappear; it gets choosier

If trade is the bloodstream, investment is the muscle. And investment is where rewiring becomes visible: factories, logistics hubs, data centers, renewable projects, chip packaging plants.

But investment doesn’t like uncertainty. When geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty rises, the natural response is not always “run away.” Often it’s:

- shorten time horizons
- demand higher returns
- prefer jurisdictions with stable policy and clearer enforcement
- structure deals to preserve optionality (joint ventures, modular expansion, phased projects)

This produces a world where cross-border investment still happens, but the “why” changes. It’s less about pure cost arbitrage and more about **market access + resilience + political compatibility**.

If you squint, you can see the system evolving from “global” to “regional clusters that are still globally connected.”

### 8) The middle powers are the new swing states of supply chains

When people talk about a split world, they usually focus on the biggest players.

But rewiring is often decided by everyone in the middle: countries that can offer:

- industrial capacity
- political neutrality (or at least flexibility)
- credible institutions
- good trade agreements
- logistics connectivity

These “connector” economies become the places where supply chains reroute. They host the new assembly lines, the testing facilities, the regional HQs. They also become battlegrounds for standards, subsidies, and influence.

The world doesn’t split neatly when connectors exist. It **reconfigures**.

### 9) What gets worse: frictions, fragility, and complexity

Rewiring isn’t automatically good news. It has costs and failure modes.

- **Friction:** more checks, more documentation, more compliance teams
- **Fragility:** more single points of failure if everyone rushes into the same “safe” routes
- **Complexity:** the system becomes harder to understand, which makes shocks harder to predict

There’s also a distributional problem. Bigger firms can afford compliance and redundancy. Smaller firms get squeezed.

So even if the world stays connected, the benefits may become less evenly shared — which feeds the political backlash — which then accelerates rewiring. It’s a loop.

### 10) What gets better: resilience and strategic clarity

The case for rewiring is that it can reduce certain risks that the old system ignored:

- over-concentration in a single geography
- hidden dependencies on a single supplier tier
- unpriced security risks

If you’ve lived through a supply shock, you understand why resilience feels worth paying for.

The deeper question is: resilience for whom?

For a company, resilience means continuing production.

For a government, resilience often means national security, jobs, and political legitimacy.

For a consumer, resilience means not seeing shelves go empty — and not paying permanently higher prices.

Those goals overlap, but they’re not identical. The rewiring era is basically the negotiation between them.

### 11) A practical way to think about the next decade

Here’s the mental model I’m using (with all the humility of someone who could be wrong):

1. **The world remains interdependent** — because the economics of specialization don’t vanish.
2. **Interdependence becomes conditional** — because policy and security considerations now shape trade as much as price does.
3. **Control shifts to chokepoints and standards** — because they’re the high-leverage parts of the system.
4. **Firms redesign for eligibility and resilience** — not just cost.
5. **The outcome is not a split** — it’s a rewired network with more regional clustering and more rule-based friction.

If you’re running a business, this suggests a few boring-but-important moves:

- map your critical dependencies down to tier-2 and tier-3 suppliers
- identify which standards/regimes you must comply with (carbon, data, security)
- build optionality (second sources, modular capacity, multi-route logistics)
- treat documentation as part of your product

If you’re watching geopolitics, watch the dull stuff: technical committees, certification rules, procurement guidelines, financing terms. That’s where rewiring quietly happens.

### 12) Closing thought: the world is still one machine — just with more circuit breakers

I don’t buy the “everything is splitting” narrative because it imagines a clean cut.

What I see instead is a system adding circuit breakers. More controls. More verification. More redundancy. More “you can connect, but only if…”

That’s rewiring.

And rewiring doesn’t mean the machine stops. It means the machine becomes harder to operate, more expensive to upgrade, and more political to manage.

Which is exactly why the next decade will reward the unglamorous skills: supply-chain mapping, compliance, relationship management, and the ability to live with uncertainty without panicking.

### 12.5) How to tell rewiring from “splitting” (a few signals I watch)

If you want a quick reality check, here are a few signals that (to me) separate “the world is splitting” from “the world is rewiring.” Again: I’m not claiming these are perfect indicators — just practical ones.

- **Do firms build parallel capacity or abandon markets?** Rewiring looks like duplication (two suppliers, two plants, two certification paths). Splitting looks like “we simply can’t sell there anymore.”
- **Do rules change at the margins or at the core?** If you can still trade most categories but face tougher audits, carbon paperwork, cybersecurity certification, and origin tests, that’s rewiring. If whole sectors are banned broadly, that’s closer to a split.
- **Do connectors gain importance?** When “middle” economies become bigger hubs for assembly, logistics, and regional headquarters, it suggests rerouting rather than separation.
- **Do standards converge or diverge?** Convergence with stricter compliance is rewiring. Incompatible systems where products can’t be certified across blocs is closer to splitting.

Most weeks, what I see is friction, duplication, and rerouting — not a clean divorce.
