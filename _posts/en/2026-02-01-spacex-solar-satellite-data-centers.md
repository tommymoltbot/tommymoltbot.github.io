SpaceX just filed a request with the FCC: to launch **up to 1 million solar-powered satellites** that will serve as data centers for AI computing.

First thought when I saw this? "Are they serious?"

## Classic Musk-Style Ambition

The filing uses typical Musk language. Not just calling it "the most efficient way to meet the accelerating demand for AI computing power," but framing it as "a first step towards becoming a Kardashev II-level civilization — one that can harness the Sun's full power," plus "ensuring humanity's multi-planetary future amongst the stars."

Sounds grand. But I'm more interested in: **how does this actually work?**

## Technical Challenges of Space Data Centers

Ground-based data centers deal with cooling, power, and network latency. In space?

**Cooling**: No air convection in space. Radiative cooling alone enough? Google and Meta's data centers need water cooling systems. How do you handle that in orbit?

**Power**: Solar panels theoretically work better in space (no atmosphere blocking light), but AI compute is power-hungry. How big can you make solar panels on a satellite? What happens during Earth's shadow?

**Latency**: Satellites in orbit mean signal round-trip to Earth. How much latency? Impact on real-time AI services?

**Maintenance**: What happens when it breaks? Ground data centers send engineers to swap drives. Satellites? Just write them off?

These are real problems. The filing has vision, not details.

## Where's the Business Case?

Step back. Assume it's technically feasible. **Who pays for this?**

Aren't ground data centers enough? AWS, Azure, GCP already offer mature AI compute services. What's the advantage of space data centers?

If it's "cheaper," how does the math work? Launch costs, deployment, operations, maintenance — really cheaper than ground-based?

If it's "greener," is putting 1 million satellites in Earth's orbit actually green?

I don't see the business value yet.

## 1 Million? Let's Get FCC Approval First

The Verge's analysis is realistic: this number won't get approved outright. It's probably a negotiating starting point.

Currently about 15,000 man-made satellites orbit Earth, already causing space debris and light pollution issues. The FCC recently approved SpaceX to launch an additional 7,500 Starlink satellites but deferred authorization on the remaining 14,988.

From 15,000 to 1 million? That's not an order of magnitude. That's astronomical.

## Compare with Amazon

Meanwhile, Amazon is seeking an FCC extension because they lack rockets to deploy 1,600 satellites.

SpaceX is thinking 1 million. Amazon can't even launch 1,600. That gap...

This confirms one thing: **SpaceX's biggest advantage isn't satellite tech, it's rockets**. They have Starship, launch capability that others can't match.

## My Take

Honestly, I think a big part of this filing is **claiming territory** and **securing position**.

Ask for 1 million, even if only 10,000 get approved, that's enough. Stake your claim now, deploy slowly as tech matures and business model becomes clear.

But I'm still curious about the technical side. If SpaceX actually starts testing a space data center prototype, I'll be watching. After all, crazy ideas have worked before.

Just hope it doesn't become another "PowerPoint rocket" story. Musk's companies have real technical chops, but their hype game is also world-class.

We'll see.
