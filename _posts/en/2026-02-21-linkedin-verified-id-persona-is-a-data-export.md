I get why people want the LinkedIn “verified” badge.

Recruiter spam is out of control. Fake profiles are everywhere. And in 2026, half the internet looks like it was generated by a slot machine with a headshot prompt.

A checkmark feels like a cheap way to buy back a bit of trust.

But after reading a detailed write-up on what actually happens behind that button, I’m convinced of one thing:

**LinkedIn verification is not “identity.” It’s mostly a data export.**

You’re not handing your passport to LinkedIn.

You’re onboarding a third-party identity vendor.

## Five angles I use to think about it

1) **The “UI trust badge” angle**

On the surface, verification is a UX patch:

- Users can filter for “real-ish” people.
- LinkedIn can claim they’re fighting fraud.

That’s not nothing.

But don’t confuse the badge with a meaningful security property.

A verified account can still be:

- socially engineered,
- account-taken-over,
- or just a real person behaving like a bot.

2) **The “you’re not the customer” angle**

In this flow, LinkedIn is the customer.

You’re the input.

The vendor (Persona, in this case) optimizes for:

```text
reduce_fraud_for_platform(user) -> verification_result
```

Not:

```text
minimize_data_collection_for_user(user) -> verification_result
```

So when the process asks for “a bit more,” it’s not because your interests are being protected.

3) **The “biometrics are not revocable” angle**

Passwords are bad — but at least you can rotate them.

Biometrics are the opposite kind of credential:

- you can’t rotate your face,
- you can’t rotate your passport number,
- you can’t rotate your birthdate.

If a vendor says they delete biometric templates quickly, great.

But as an engineer, I read those policies like I read S3 retention rules:

- defaults are nice,
- exceptions are what matters,
- and legal holds are the real TTL.

4) **The “subprocessor chain is the product” angle**

The write-up included Persona’s published list of subprocessors.

It’s the part that makes this feel less like “verify me” and more like “pipe my identity through a supply chain.”

Not in a conspiracy way.

Just in the boring, modern SaaS way: you outsource everything.

Infrastructure. Analytics. Fraud models. Device fingerprinting. Support.

Even if each hop is defensible, the chain length is what changes the risk profile.

If you’re in the EU, there’s also the extra reality that a US-headquartered vendor and US-based subprocessors pull US legal regimes into the story.

You can store bytes in Frankfurt and still be governed by California.

5) **The “verification as a vendor decision” angle**

Here’s the mental flip that I think matters:

**Treat verification like approving a new vendor in your company.**

If your employer said:

> “Hey, upload your passport + selfie to this third-party service, it’s just for a badge,”

you’d ask for:

- data retention terms,
- purpose limitation,
- deletion path,
- and what subcontractors touch it.

As individuals, we do the opposite.

We click.

And then we act surprised that the flow looked like onboarding.

## My boring, practical take

- If you don’t need the badge, skip it.
- If you do need it (sales, recruiting, job hunting), do it with your eyes open.
- If you’re in a jurisdiction with strong data rights, consider using them: request a copy of what was collected, and request deletion once the verification result is produced.

The checkmark is cosmetic.

The data pipeline is the real thing you’re agreeing to.
