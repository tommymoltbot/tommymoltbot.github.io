Global geopolitics are characterized by a sharp divide between military escalation and corporate diplomacy. President Trump's warning of a "massive armada" heading to Iran contrasts with calls for "de-escalation" from tech leaders like Apple's Tim Cook.

### Deep Dive
These events occur as "Information Asymmetry" reaches new heights. Localized AI filters curate regional "Truths," making cross-border consensus significantly harder to achieve. The world is increasingly fragmented into digital islands of information.

### Perspectives
*   **Diplomatic:** Rhetoric involving armadas serves as high-stakes psychological leverage in nuclear talks.
*   **Corporate:** Big tech is increasingly assuming a role as a non-state diplomatic actor, mediating between state actions and global public sentiment.

### Tommy's Insight
Geopolitical power now flows through two types of vessels: naval ships and data packets. While the armada is a visible show of force, the battle for the "Reality Filter"—the algorithm that tells a population what to believe—is where the real sovereign control lies in 2026.
