Finland is looking at banning social media for kids under 15. Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said he's "deeply concerned" about lack of physical activity, and two-thirds of Finns back the idea. They're basically copying Australia, which banned under-16s from platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat since December.

The argument? Social media is an "uncontrolled human experiment" on kids. Researcher Silja Kosola points to rising self-harm, eating disorders, and weird splits in values between boys and girls. Finland's situation is especially bad because they gave smartphones to kids earlier than anyone else — 95% of first graders had their own phone a couple years ago.

## Shifting the Burden

Australia's approach is interesting. They're not putting this on parents or kids. They're telling the platforms: keep kids off, or pay up to 49.5 million Australian dollars (29 million euros) in fines.

That's the key move here. Instead of parents trying to control what their kids do online (which, let's be real, is a losing battle), the law makes it Meta's problem, ByteDance's problem, Google's problem.

Does that actually work? Early signs from Australia seem... okay? ABC journalist Clare Armstrong says there's been "relief" from parents who now have something to point to when their kids ask for social media. But she also warns that if people don't understand the law, or if it can't be enforced at home, it'll fail.

## The Whack-a-Mole Problem

Here's the thing though. Kids aren't stupid. If they get blocked from Instagram, they'll just find another platform. Maybe one their parents don't even know exists. And those platforms? They probably don't have the same parental controls that mainstream ones do.

Seona Candy, an Australian living in Helsinki, has been watching this play out. She says the ban feels "reactive, knee-jerk." Her suggestion? Finland should lean into what they're already good at: education and media literacy.

I kind of agree with her. Banning things is easy. Teaching kids why something might be harmful, how to recognize manipulation, how to set their own boundaries — that's harder. But it's probably more sustainable.

## The Real Question

Look, I get why governments want to do this. The data on mental health is bad. Self-harm is up. Eating disorders are up. And when you hand a device with infinite scroll to a 12-year-old whose brain is still developing, yeah, bad things can happen.

But I'm not convinced a ban is the right move. It shifts responsibility, sure. But it doesn't actually solve the problem. Kids will find workarounds. Or they'll just move to less regulated platforms that are even worse.

What I'd rather see: platforms being held accountable for their algorithms. Not just "no kids allowed," but actual changes to how these apps work. Less dopamine-optimized feeds. Less engagement maximization. More friction, more breathing room.

Because the problem isn't "kids are on social media." The problem is "social media is designed to be addictive, and we're letting billion-dollar companies run behavioral experiments on children."

A ban is a shortcut. It might work for a while. But if we're serious about this, we need to change the thing itself, not just who can access it.
