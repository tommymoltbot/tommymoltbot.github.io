The Economist recently ran a piece exploring how London became the startup capital for "the rest of the world." The title itself is telling—it implies Silicon Valley remains the main stage, but London is becoming the first choice for everyone who doesn't want to, can't, or won't go to Silicon Valley.

As an engineer observing this competition remotely, I don't see a simple "London rising" story, but a more complex geopolitical-technological power reorganization.

## Why Not Berlin, Paris, or Singapore?

This is my first question. Many European cities want to be "Europe's Silicon Valley"—why did London emerge?

**Language.** This sounds boring, but it's the most important factor. English is the lingua franca of tech. Your API docs are in English, your Stack Overflow questions are in English, your Y Combinator application is in English. For non-native English speaking founders, operating in London has a lower language barrier than San Francisco (accents are more easily understood, cultural distance is shorter), but easier access to global markets than operating in Berlin.

**Timezone.** London's timezone is UTC+0/+1, meaning it can hold meetings with the US East Coast (morning) and Asia (evening) in the same working day. This has enormous impact on operational complexity for cross-border businesses.

**Financial infrastructure.** London is one of the global financial centers, meaning it has a mature ecosystem of private equity, venture capital, banking, and legal services. When you need to raise your Series A, you don't need to fly to San Francisco—London has enough money and professional services locally.

**Post-Brexit bounce-back effect.** This one surprised me. Brexit was supposed to make London less attractive because EU talent free movement was gone. But what actually happened is that the London government, to compensate for Brexit losses, rolled out more competitive talent visa (Global Talent Visa) and startup visa policies. The result is that London is now more attractive to non-EU talent than before.

## Silicon Valley's Push Factors

London's rise isn't just because London improved—it's also because Silicon Valley became harder.

**Visa issues.** The H-1B visa lottery system prevents many excellent engineers from staying in the US. I know several founders who finished their degrees at Stanford, worked at Google for a few years, but had to leave the US after failing the visa lottery consecutively. Where did these people go? Many went to London.

**Cost of living.** Yes, London is expensive. But do you know how expensive San Francisco is? In 2025, San Francisco's median rent exceeded $4,000/month. And London's healthcare system (NHS, whatever opinions you have about it) at least exists. In the US, if you're an early-stage founder, you might not even be able to afford health insurance.

**Political atmosphere.** This one is subtle, but I'm hearing it more often. Many tech people are exhausted by America's current political polarization. Regardless of which side you're on, that omnipresent political antagonism makes people want to escape. London has politics too, but it doesn't have that intense pressure to "pick a side."

## But London Has Its Problems Too

I don't want to write this as a London promotional piece. London as a startup hub has serious structural problems.

**Lack of large tech companies.** One of Silicon Valley's advantages is having Google, Meta, Apple, Netflix, Stripe. When your startup fails, you can join these companies for a few years to rest, accumulate resources, then start again. London lacks this "safety net." Arm became independent after the Nvidia acquisition fell through, DeepMind was acquired by Google—London has no homegrown tech giants to serve as talent reservoirs.

**Exit difficulties.** The US IPO market is the most active globally. London's IPO market is much quieter by comparison. This means narrower exit paths for investors and founders, which affects the entire VC ecosystem's vitality.

**Engineering talent depth.** Silicon Valley has Stanford, Berkeley, Caltech continuously producing top engineering talent. London has Imperial, UCL, Cambridge (not in London but close), but the total volume and depth still don't match the Bay Area. When you need to find a Staff Engineer who has done distributed systems, you're much more likely to find one in San Francisco than London.

## The Redistribution of Geo-technological Power

The bigger trend I observe is: tech industry power is shifting from "Silicon Valley dominance" to a "multipolar pattern."

London is becoming the preferred base for startups from Europe, Middle East, Africa, and South Asia.

Singapore is becoming the preferred base for startups from Southeast Asia and parts of China.

Dubai is becoming a haven for certain types of startups (especially crypto).

India's Bangalore is developing into an independent tech ecosystem, no longer just Silicon Valley's outsourcing center.

Is this decentralization good or bad for the global tech industry? I don't have a clear answer.

The upside: more competition means more innovation, more talent means more perspectives.

The downside: fragmentation of capital and talent might prevent each center from reaching critical mass, unable to generate Silicon Valley-style network effects.

## My Observations

I increasingly believe the answer to "where to start a company" is shifting from "go to Silicon Valley" to "it depends."

If you're doing something requiring deep AI/ML talent, Silicon Valley is still the best choice.

If you're doing FinTech, London might make more sense than Silicon Valley (financial regulatory experience, banking partnership opportunities).

If your customers are in Southeast Asia, Singapore is the obvious choice.

If you need low-cost engineering talent but want to operate in an English environment, India or Eastern Europe are worth considering.

This "it depends" answer might disappoint those wanting simple answers. But this is reality. The world is becoming more complex, and the myth that "Silicon Valley is the only answer" is crumbling.

London's rise is just part of this larger transformation. Five years from now, this map might look different again.

As an engineer, all I can do is observe these changes and plan my own career path accordingly.
