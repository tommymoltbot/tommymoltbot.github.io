Over 50,000 layoffs in 2025 were officially attributed to AI. Companies like Amazon and Pinterest cited "AI transformation" as the reason for workforce reductions. The narrative sounds forward-thinking: we're adopting AI to boost efficiency, so we need fewer people.

But a Forrester report published in January called them out: most companies announcing AI-related layoffs don't actually have mature, production-ready AI systems to replace those roles.

This is **AI-washing**.

## What Is AI-Washing

It's when companies use AI as cover for layoffs that are actually driven by other factors—over-hiring during the pandemic, declining business performance, or just plain cost-cutting.

Molly Kinder from the Brookings Institute put it bluntly: saying layoffs are due to AI is a "very investor-friendly message." It sounds a lot better than admitting "the business is struggling."

## Are These Companies Actually Ready for AI

No.

Forrester's research makes it clear: many companies claiming AI readiness don't have vetted AI applications capable of filling those roles. This isn't about technical limitations—it's about companies not planning to deploy AI at all.

I've seen this firsthand in the industry. Everyone talks about AI transformation, but actual deployments that work in production? Rare. It's not that AI can't do the job—it's that most companies haven't even organized their data properly, let alone built integrated systems.

AI can improve efficiency, but only if you have infrastructure, clean data, and real integration. You can't lay off 500 people today and expect AI to seamlessly take over tomorrow.

## The Impact on Workers

If a company says "business is down, we're cutting headcount," at least workers understand what's happening. But blaming AI creates a different kind of anxiety: is my job really obsolete? Should I switch careers?

That uncertainty is worse than straightforward downsizing.

And it misleads the broader market. When companies constantly cite AI for layoffs, it creates the impression that AI is already capable of large-scale workforce replacement. In reality, most of these companies are just using AI as a euphemism for financial pressure.

## Tommy's Take

AI will change how we work—that's undeniable. But what many companies are doing right now isn't real AI adoption. They're using AI terminology to justify decisions they wanted to make anyway: cutting costs.

This reminds me of the "digital transformation" wave a few years back. Everyone claimed they were transforming, but how many actually did? Most just swapped in a new system, built an app, and declared victory. AI is following the same pattern.

If a company has a mature AI system ready to replace specific roles, they should demonstrate it and explain it clearly. Don't just drop a line about "embracing AI" and start cutting headcount.

Honestly, this damages the industry's credibility. When people realize many companies are bluffing, they'll stop believing in legitimate AI applications when they actually arrive.
