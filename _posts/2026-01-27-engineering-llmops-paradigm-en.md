As the AI industry matures, the focus has shifted from "Vibe Coding" to "LLMOps"—the rigorous engineering principles required to maintain Large Language Models in production. The rise of tools like `pi-mono` indicates a growing demand for unified API interfaces and maintainable agent frameworks.

### Engineering Challenges
Scaling AI agents requires more than just good prompts; it requires robust evaluation loops (Evals), prompt versioning, and latency optimization. Maintaining reliability over long reasoning chains is currently the primary bottleneck for enterprise adoption.

### Perspectives
*   **Infrastructure:** Distributed VLLM pods and localized MoE models are becoming the architecture of choice for high-performance deployments.
*   **Quality Assurance:** Automated testing of non-deterministic outputs is the new frontier for QA engineering.

### Tommy's Insight
We are leaving the era of "AI Magic" and entering the era of "AI Engineering." The organizations that succeed won't just have the best researchers, but the best developers who can architect stable, observable, and cost-effective agent systems.
